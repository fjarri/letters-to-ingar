# "Excerpts from the letters to Ingar" (fantasy-examination)

*Pronin Antiul*

## Preface

This story began a year ago when in a conversation with an acquaintance (a Tolkienist LARPer) I just wanted to make a joke... At that moment there was enough beer sloshing inside us (so the necessary boldness was ensured), I had some idea about the subject, and a desire to overload the interlocutor's brain is something I always possess... What did you say? Tolkien? Why not? It could all remain at the level of an innocent joke, but next morning I decided to verify some statements I made the previous evening in an alcoholic delirium... And why the hell did I sign up for this galley! I had to carry on with the joke a bit longer than I expected... And, frankly, I do not regret the time spent on an absolutely delirious and, because of that, a crazy interesting work — proving something that is impossible to prove... That's how "Letters to Ingar" were born. After some internal struggle, I decided to keep the title. Despite the fact that these notes have nothing to do with the letters, or with Ingar for that matter.

So, what is it, "The Lord of the Rings"? One can propose two initial versions:

1) a fairy tale with a claim to morality;
2) a story of an eyewitness that was obtained in some unspecified way.

Since the former is more in line with common sense, it does not interest me at all. Of course, I picked the latter. Such an approach, perhaps, would raise a storm of protest from Tolkien himself. The fact is that the Professor, a devout Catholic, was creating a *Christian* novel. Do you not believe me? Look at the author's comments on LotR. All the religious interpretations will dazzle the eye. In particular, the "Fire of Anor", by which Gandalf frightens the Balrog on the bridge of Khazad-Dum, is nothing but the Holy Spirit. I provide a slightly different explanation... Of course, I deeply respect the intentions of JRR, but is the result always consistent with the plan? The symbol of romanticism Don Quixote, for example, was conceived by Cervantes as a parody of knightly novels! Maybe the Master discovered the truth, gave it to us, but himself... was too afraid to believe in it?.. Here I tried to prove or disprove this delusional hypothesis. How successful I was — judge for yourself...

For each of my assumptions and conjectures, I meticulously searched for confirmation in the text, and if I could not find it — I choked it mercilessly. The primary sources used were /changed to the corresponding English editions — *translator.*/:

1) "The Lord of the Rigs", Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1991;
2) "Silmarillion", HarperCollins e-books, 2009;
3) "The Hobbit...", London, Unwin Books, 1966.

Now, rereading what has been written, it is amusing to observe how the "literary" style has transformed from a cheeky one into a dry newspaper-like and then into a lofty poetic one over time; opinions and sympathies have changed... Something I, of course, will try to remake, something I will leave as is. The most important and joyful thing for me is that the work is finished, and this obsession can safely leave the skull, making room for a new one... Well, listen to my requiem...

Imagine a man who climbed into the attic of an abandoned house. He approaches a boarded-up window, tears off a couple of boards, and sees a wonderful, stunning world! And there is someone sitting under the window, graciously providing explanations for everything that is unclear. In the case of JRR, there was an elf under the window. As a result, a biased story took shape, full of gaps and understatements. But that story was sincere! It is detailed to the point of tediousness in terms of geography, linguistics, and folklore, but it completely lacks in two aspects: **politics** and **religion.** As if that benevolent guide gently shied away from the answers to these questions: *"Come on, old boy, do not bother your head, better look here!.."* It seems that I looked in a slightly different direction, and the first thing that caught my eye were three episodes, very strange ones, that do not fit in the canvas of the main story. These are peaceful, somewhat drawn-out chapters — all chatter and not a single murder. Usually, they are skimmed through, without chewing: conversations in the Shire, the council of Elrond and the visit to Lorien. But a careful analysis of these episodes reveals the bird's-eye view of an amazing chess game played by Gandalf and Sauron on the board of Middle-earth.

This game began with the manufacture of the first elven ring and, essentially, ended then and there: elves lost Middle-earth. Sauron was rubbing his hands. A couple of thousand years until the word "checkmate" did not particularly worry him. Gil-galad and Elendil managed to delay the completion of the game significantly. Let the memory of them live forever! I do not want to dwell on the events of those years now — it is a separate conversation and a very interesting topic. I will go straight to the analysis of the "endgame" when Grandmaster Olorin (Gan.) joined the game.

It all began with Gandalf and Thorin meeting in the "Prancing Pony". Gandalf was worried about the affairs in the north, *"... Sauron was plotting war, and intended, as soon as he felt strong enough, to attack Rivendell."* (LotR, App. A, III. "Durin's Folk") Gandalf hoped that it was dwarves who would block the passes through the Misty Mountains, but Smaug was in the way.

So, Gandalf and Thorin form an alliance and organize an expedition to the Lonely Mountain. The goal is common, to destroy the dragon. And now, my friends, explain to me, why the devil was a hobbit required there? Why is the good old Gandalf put a plain sad sack in a squad of thirteen thugs? Couldn't he find a real burglar?! To me, the answer is obvious. Gandalf couldn't care less for the mountain passes or the dragon! He was just... looking for the Sauron's Ring! The global uncertainty associated with this object, it seems, worried him very much. It's impossible to work like this! Any ingenious strategic plan could at any moment go down in flames just because the wrong monkey was playing with a grenade... And Gandalf the chess player becomes a card player for a while. He bets not on logic, but on luck. And chooses the performer perfectly. A professional will not go where he does not need to go, he will not have to be carried half of the way on someone's back, he will act competently, and he will survive... But he will not find the Ring! It is a hobbit, who has spent all of his life in a burrow, who is most susceptible to the magical, hypnotic or whichever conditioning for the search. The odds are not great. This fool will poke his nose into every hole, create a thousand problems and surely will ruin the squad, but **who knows?!**

Of course, the probability of winning in such a lottery is negligible, but the player is extremely persistent! I share the Bilbo's admiration: *"... Not the Gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures."* ("Hobbit", Ch. 1) Search parties, gentlemen, were sent by Gandalf **regularly!** How many of them, those little involuntary dowsers, piled their heads on the roads of Middle-earth in the name of a goal unknown to them? Only Gandalf knows...

And finally, the Ring was found in 2941 of the Third Age (shame on the opponents of roulettes and scams!). Until 3001, it is stored in Hobbiton, at Bilbo's. It has taken sharp-witted Gandalf 60 years to understand everything, and his wit does not fail him. In my opinion — utter nonsense! The Grey Wizard recognized the ring at once, and he repeatedly lets it out in the conversation with Frodo: *"I wondered often how Gollum came by a Great Ring, as plainly it was — that at least was clear from the first."* — perhaps, the most frank of his "slip-ups" (LotR, Book I, Ch. 2). Excuse me, gentlemen, there are exactly 20 Great Rings in existence, and exactly one of them has no stone... And most importantly, I cannot believe that Gandalf did not feel that powerful aura of attraction that surrounded the Ring. He felt it all right! And shied away from it like a nun from an issue of "Playboy".

"You're a bore," you will say, "well, he guessed, so what? What's the difference?!" And the difference is very big. Some hobbit lives in a burrow and for 60 years keeps in his possession something that is comparable to a fusion charge, capable of turning Middle-earth upside down!..

A question arises then, why was Gandalf searching for a description of the Ring in the archives of Gondor, if everything was clear to him as it is? I think, "only just" to convince the Council and, first of all, Frodo of the authenticity of the artifact. Gandalf needed a Ring-bearer fully aware of the greatness of the task entrusted! So that in comparison to it, the life of some halfling would look pathetic and worthless. For such a task can only be accomplished through absolute and **voluntary** self-sacrifice. Indeed, the trick with the fiery letters produced the desired effect on the hobbit.

And a question again... Why had this trump ace been hidden in the sleeve for the whole **sixty** years?! At this point, it is necessary to have a closer look at the political situation of Middle-earth of that period, as I imagine it.

And the situation is quite peaceful! The military conflict with Sauron is smoldering, orcs are being restless somewhere, the Easterlings someplace else... The main thing is that this lull suits everyone. Sauron can calmly pretend that he is looking for the Ring, and elves can be leaving Middle-earth without any hurry. Old boy Gandalf is particularly pleased — the situation is completely under control. Of course, such an idyll cannot last forever. Sooner or later, Sauron will have to crawl out of his den (one must pay back for Harad's humanitarian aid), and Gandalf, let us give him his due, understands it and does not sit around. He creates an "antisauronian committee", or, more simply, a conspiracy. It includes himself, Elrond and a unique character — Aragorn. At the time when Bilbo — a pure soul — hides from the Sackville-Bagginses with the help of some useful thing, this trio has long kept the secret of the Ring and keeps an eye on Hobbiton. Aragorn's thugs even secretly guard the borders of the Shire. And for the last seventeen years, there have been *double* guards! Isn't it too much fuss for some unidentified little ring?

But suddenly everything explodes. The reason is Gollum. By the way, I demand that this creature is given the honorary title of Ring-bearer. It suits him completely and entirely.

So, this freak wanders into Mordor, and there they untie his tongue. The Nazgul appear in the Shire. Frodo leaves for Rivendell. Things are starting to happen...

I omit some very important moments of this flight, reluctantly, but they are the topic of another chapter. I'll go straight to the council of Elrond. It is a performance, gentlemen! Everything was decided about twenty years ago, if not earlier. Please note how, as if by chance, the representatives of all the interested parties happened to find themselves in Rivendell. Especially I was touched by a couple of dwarves who came all the way "for advice" from the Lonely Mountain. They practically reek of elfophobia!..

And yet, the Fellowship is assembled from representatives of different nations. Sometimes hating each other. Moreover, each of the Company, first of all, takes care of the interests of his anthill, and only then of the ideas of the Great Helmsman... But let's talk about it in detail.


### Boromir

*"On one occasion at least your counsel has prevailed, not long ago. It was the Lord of the City that gave the errand to him /Boromir/."* (Faramir to Denethor, LotR, Book V, Ch. 4)

*"... Would that this thing had come to me!"* (Denethor, ibid.)

Perhaps only the simple-minded hobbits could have swallowed the tale that Boromir presented. The best warrior of Gondor left for six months to get some advice and interpret a dream. Not to mention, alone. No, gentlemen, only an extremely important and secret mission could tear off the High Warden of the White Tower from the war. Naturally, Elrond sent out invitations in advance. Most likely, immediately as soon as Gandalf interrogated Gollum and realized that the Enemy knew everything. Of course, Elrond could not keep an event of such importance in secret from Denethor. The ruler could be offended, and very much so. And elves at that time were not so strong to just let allies fall through the cracks.

So Boromir left for Rivendell with a single and quite specific task: to deliver the Ring to Minas Tirith.


### The hobbits

I think the Grey Wizard repeatedly blessed the day and the hour when he came across these little adventurers. The people who are virtually not susceptible to the destructive influence of the Ring, devoid of aspiration for world domination, honest, unselfish and devoted; the people who are so easy to deceive, the people who dream of adventures and heroic deeds for their own sake and, most importantly, the people whom no one takes seriously! This card, hidden in the sleeve of the old sharper, turned into a trump card! A dwarf, an elf, or, especially, a man could not even be allowed close to the Ring. The bickering would start right away! But while the ring is in the hobbit's possession, everyone is happy, and nobody quarrels. And who do you think would become the Ring-bearer if Frodo died in Moria? I think — Sam would... The King is dead, but the show must go on! That's why there are three "extra" halflings in the squad and not three musclebound thugs. While at least one hobbit is alive, the mission is alive as well.


### Aragorn

Who is he? Essentially — a nobody! The Star of Hope, promoted by Elrond and brought up in loyalty to elves in the era of their decline. His accession in Gondor guaranteed the Firstborn a proud departure and not a stampede. But without a war with Mordor, it is pointless to dream of the throne of Minas Tirith, since power is not a thing passed at the first request, and the sword of Elendil is not an argument in favor of a dubious vagabond...

But Aragorn has a stronger proof of his rights. His Excalibur is not the Broken Sword at all. His true sword, his only trump card is the Stone of Erech! And Aragorn plays it masterfully, sweeping both Umbar in the mouth of Anduin and Sauron's hordes on the Pelennor Fields with one blow. He does not enter the city as a supplicant but as a savior. The crown settles on his head as if by itself.

Of all the characters in the book, Aragorn, perhaps, is the most titanic and powerful figure. Being completely dependent on Elrond, he did not just avoid becoming an elven puppet (as some people would like it, and let's not point fingers in the direction of the Golden Wood), but also acquired an extraordinary authority among the Firstborn. Surprisingly, Elrond, who had sheltered young Estel for purely political reasons, soon began to experience fatherly feelings towards him.

In short, Aragorn is just a Gandalf's deputy. No more, no less, if you understand what I mean, of course.


### Gimli

As for dwarves, I have a strong suspicion that they were supposed to be left behind. But Sauron intervened. It was from him that the Lonely Mountain received the information about the big game that was being planned. *"As a small token only of your friendship Sauron asks this: that you should find this thief and get from him, willing or no, a little ring, the least of rings, that once he stole."* (LotR, Book II, Ch. 2) Sauron did not even entertain the thought that dwarves would buy into his promises. The purpose of this embassy is to include them in the game and provoke them into a squabble with elves. The difficulty was that pulling a dwarf out of a mountain is very difficult. The Nazgul had to be sent three times (!) to hammer away methodically at the same spot. Finally, they got it. Dain started to roll over, woke up and became agitated: what if elves lay their hands on the Ring! A nightmare! Unacceptable. And as an observer to the Rivendell goes not just anybody, but Gloin himself, who feels, to put it mildly, antipathy towards elves. And if the father at least hides his credo under sugary politeness, the son can often be seen clenching his jaws. And it breaks through at the parting: *"Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens,"* he declares to Elrond (!) (LotR, Book II, Ch. 3) "I do not believe you," if one translates it. However, all this is just lyrics...

So, Elrond is forced to include a dwarf in the Fellowship, and this is more of an observer from the allies than a Frodo's bodyguard. If events begin to develop in an undesirable manner for the Durin's folk, Gimli will be obliged to interrupt the mission even at the cost of his own life. I think it is not necessary to remind you what this guy is capable of in a brawl. This burden of a suicide mission brought him to a spiritual rapprochement with another similar kamikaze observer.


### Legolas

(*"Let it be a man not from our neighborhood..."* — comrade Saakhov, from the movie "Kidnapping, Caucasian Style")

Why a Mirkwood elf? Let's forget about Lorien for a while, but the fighters of Rivendell are not worse. Even better... Nevertheless, Frodo is accompanied by Legolas. As the reason for his appearance at the council, he names the Gollum's escape. But this is not the reason, but rather a consequence... But more on this later...

By the way, what is Mirkwood? Rivendell and Lorien were described in detail, the Havens have their own role (they will also get theirs a bit later), but Thranduil's domain is a rather obscure territory. I believe that it is here that you can find the roots of the tragedy and, if you like, the curse of elves.

Did it not strike you as odd that Thranduil's son had never visited Celeborn? They are allies, one people, just good neighbors, after all. Lorien is closed, you would say, and you would be damned right. And especially it is closed from the various rabble, who did not see the light of Valinor, who did not talk with Varda and, most importantly, who are not vassals of the Lady of Light!

Legolas's mission gave Thranduil a unique opportunity to step over the snobbery of the Lords of the Golden Wood, stand together with them, or even higher. At the end of the elves' existence in Middle-earth, they finally had a real chance of the final rallying, and this chance was created by Gandalf. Elrond was fully in agreement. Galadriel took this step compulsively since she just could not supply her own candidate.

But in addition to being the symbol of unification, Legolas had to take on another task, not so romantic — overseeing the men. If during the operation, say, Boromir or, especially, Aragorn had his own ideas about the Ring — a root that heals all the diseases, including the lust for power, would be found in the Legolas's bag. An elf from Rivendell would not dare (Aragorn's reputation there was very high), but a Sindar from Mirkwood will do everything quickly and without hesitation. And what is important, only Thranduil will be responsible for this, while Elrond will retain both the face and the union with the Dunedain.

Of course, such an outcome was planned by the organizers of the campaign as the most extreme, because, after all, the squad included


### Gandalf

I sincerely pity Sauron. His military-political inventions often command respect, and even admiration... but in comparison with Gandalf's actions, they seem very laborious. (I'm not even mentioning Saruman. He is a boy from a chess club who started playing with a grandmaster.) Sauron's moves are carefully thought out and prepared in advance, while Gandalf does everything impromptu — his blows are unexpected and beautiful. It's a song! It is something that requires inspiration, the joy of playing for the sake of the game itself. Saruman surrounded himself with luxury, Sauron piled up monumental fortresses, and Gandalf wandered around in rags. Perhaps he did not need anything besides this war, hopeless for any sane person.

Personally, I found only one miscalculation in the actions of the wizard — he did not isolate Gollum immediately after Bilbo's trip. As a result, information about the Ring reached Sauron. But is this really a miscalculation?.. What if all, absolutely **all** of Gandalf's actions were intentional and had a double bottom?!. In this case, gentlemen, we have a creator of realities of the unique class in front of us, and it's not for me, a wretched one, to pick demiurge's deeds with my finger!.. But, God, how boring it would be...

In addition, it is unethical to adopt a verdict of the impeccancy of the Maia, when the Valar themselves made a bunch of mistakes. And, after all, an image of tired old boy Gan is closer and more familiar to me, and this is why I will start over. So, Gandalf in the Company is the main striking force and a guarantor of stability. He is the only one who can keep Boromir in check as his teacher and educator (*"For Boromir was loyal to me and no wizard's pupil"* — Denethor, Book V, Ch. 4) /In the Russian translation the corresponding part literally states that Boromir had a wizard for a teacher, but stayed loyal to Denethor; in the original it may clearly imply that Boromir has never even met a wizard. — *translator.*/ His task was to bring the squad to Lorien. And further, having sent the hobbits with the Ring to Orodruin, go down the river to Gondor yelling "Cuckoo, Sauron, we are here! Bet you can't catch us!"

What makes you think that the breaking of the Fellowship was planned? — you will ask me. The answer is given by Gollum, oddly enough... He started following the Company in Moria. And what was he doing there? Waiting for Frodo, you will say. Yes, that's right... A poor little maniac, led by a single obsession, is patiently sitting in the dark and waiting. But how did he know that he had to wait there of all places?! He was planted there by someone who knew the route. Who knew that the Company would not be able to go through the pass at Caradhras, would be stopped by a snowstorm, and would not turn back!.. And this mysterious manipulator can only be Gandalf. We have discussed the possibility, let's discuss the motive. So, why? Pretty simple! Gandalf understood perfectly well that only small, clever hobbits could penetrate into the heart of Mordor, and not a mob of goons armed with axes and bows. The breaking of the Fellowship was inevitable! But this means that the control over Frodo will be lost. Who knows what a halfling with the Ring will take into his head if you give him a bit of freedom. And Gandalf shackles Gollum to Frodo. A whip and a compass. Gollum will drive the Ring-bearer to Orodruin, not giving him time to fantasize about world domination, and, best case scenario, will even show him the way. And most importantly, this is additional protection! No, not for Frodo, for the Ring. Gollum will not allow his Precious to return to Sauron. While it is in the hobbit's possession, he has hope. And Sauron does not fit together with hope at all. Gollum will protect the Ring from orcs like a ferret. And the "escape" of Gollum from the elves of Mirkwood, which Legolas lamented about so much at the council in Rivendell, immediately becomes clear. He was simply released from the pen by a signal from a starting pistol, and after that, they probably whistled at his back too. Undoubtedly, Gollum represents a great danger. But Gandalf has calculated everything! While creating this odd diversionary group, he, first of all, ensured the safety of Frodo. Sam... "Ha!!!," you will say with contempt, and you will be wrong. A little gardener who fled home "to see elves," suddenly becomes an extra class bodyguard! In his devotion to the Master, there is something abnormal, comparable only to Gollum's obsession. The Ring has no power over him **at all!** During their whole track through Mordor, Sam, it seems, does not even sleep! Essentially, he's a guardian robot. And Gollum himself? His attitude towards Frodo is anything but hatred. Frodo is the Master for both of them. Gandalf, Gandalf! How many intimate conversations did you finish with the words *"and when I count to three you will wake up"?..*

Without hesitation and remorse, Gandalf sentences to death those who love him and believe in him. But a moment is waiting for him when he must lie on the sacrificial stone himself. And he goes for it in exactly the same way, without hesitation! And suddenly it becomes clear that, first of all, he is a warrior! Gandalf the politician, Gandalf the schemer, Gandalf the spy — all this falls off him as a husk on the bridge of Khazad-Dum. In the flame of Anor and Udun, he hardens the chain that links the Fellowship together into a whole, and it is right here where the first nail is driven into Sauron's coffin. And on the board of Middle-earth appears a new, very maneuverable and dangerous figure — the Fellowship of the Ring.


## Chapter 1, a warming-up one

*This people occupies the first place in the book in terms of the amount of disguised information about the real state of affairs in Middle-earth. A kind of a homing pigeon. When it comes to events related to it, it feels like a benevolent Eldar in civilian clothes was standing behind the writer's back and prompting: "Do skip this, sir, it's not interesting... And here, please, in more detail..." But it is impossible to gag the master of the word! Under the most severe supervision, he managed to insert grains of truth in the message. And this truth, at times, turns upside down the traditional views on "LotR". So, one of my favorite topics:*


### Orcs

Dirty, bloodthirsty, treacherous, vile etc. Even their origin repels any respectable person: they are renegades, "altered" Avari. What can be more disgusting! The very insistence with which Tolkien describes the vices of orcs should cause a lot of suspicions already. A build-up of propaganda for soldiers during a war — that's what it sounds like. Orcs are the absolute enemies! Evil in its pure form. They only deserve destruction... The funny thing is that this skyscraper of anti-orc propaganda is broken by Tolkien himself with several lines:

With the description of Balin's tombstone.

*"The light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the room: a single oblong block, about two feet high, upon which was laid a great slab of white stone... On the slab runes were deeply graven."* (LotR, Book II, Ch. 4) It is not split by hammer blows, it is not painted with indecent drawings and swastikas, it is not plundered! Gentlemen, it only lacks some fresh flowers... (I wonder, were dwarves as respectful towards Azog's tomb?) *"We are the fighting Uruk-hai! We slew the great warrior!"* (LotR, Book III, Ch. 3) — in these words there is the explanation... Valor is the only thing important for an orc in this world, regardless of who is exhibiting it. I have no doubt that it was valor that determined the position of each warrior on the social ladder. Of the peoples of the Earth, Turks are an obvious analog. They even have the same weapons, if we assume that Tolkien got it wrong and called a yataghan a scimitar. /In the Russian translation, the orcs' weapons are indeed called "yataghans" and not "scimitars" as in the original. Nevertheless, the argument (after a certain change of phrasing) still stands, especially since it is not essential to the main idea of the article — *translator.*/

In general, the global condemnation of orcs in Middle-earth can be considered one of the greatest victories of elven diplomacy. "Who are you?" — "A man" — "Where from?" — the question follows... "Who are you?" — "An orc" — and the hand reaches for the sword... And what do we know about them? Very little! And what did Tolkien pass on to us? A lot!!!

During the War of the Rings, there were four major orc settlements in Middle-earth. It's not a secret. Two of them — Dol Guldur and Mordor can be politically united. "What about Moria?" — you will ask mockingly! — "No way!" — I will answer with a smile. Proofs? I got them! But first I want to make an official statement: **Moria has never belonged to Sauron.** Sorry for the pathos — it's personal...

To confirm this, a short quote: *"Sauron was plotting war, and intended, as soon as he felt strong enough, to attack Rivendell. But to resist any attempt from the East to regain the lands of Angmar and the northern passes in the mountains there were now only the Dwarves of the Iron Hills."* (LotR, Appendix A, III. Durin's folk) This is from a conversation between Gandalf and Thorin in "The Prancing Pony." Nonsense, of course, nobody intended to strike a blow at Rivendell, but Thorin swallows "the northern passes." It's no longer nonsense, we are straight up told that Sauron can not take advantage of comfortable, warm and dry Moria tunnels. There is another master there, he would bow before Morgoth, but before Sau — never! Otherwise, the history of Middle-earth would have gone a different way. But luckily for everyone, the Balrog did not intend to leave the cozy caves. Even less he wanted to participate in some absurd squabbles, where one can even get killed...

In general, in the story with the Durin's Bane, there are a lot of suspicious blind spots. Almost all the failures of dwarves in the Third Age are attributed to the poor Balrog. Unfortunately, the history of dwarves itself is covered in the book very sparingly, not to mention that of the Balrog. But there is one very expressive moment...

In the battle of Azanulbizar, in the very place where Dain Ironfoot slew Azog, the Balrog stood at the gate of Moria, without interfering in the battle. *"Elsewhere the battle swayed to and fro with great slaughter, until at last the people of the Iron Hills turned the day."* (LotR, Appendix A, III. Durin's folk) And what if the Balrog had simply stepped out of the Gates before the approach of those dwarves?.. The dwarves would have wavered, and the outcome of the battle would have been different... But the Balrog stood in the shade and watched calmly how the army of Azog perished! *"Only I have looked through the shadow of the Gate. Beyond the shadow it waits for you still: Durin's Bane."* (Dain to Thrain, ibid.) By the way, the dying orcs also did not reach out to the Balrog with their paws, appealing for help... What's the matter? I hope, no-one is going to ascribe photophobia to him! There can be the only answer — the ruler of Moria explicitly and unambiguously demonstrated his **neutrality.**

But let's get back to Moria and our orcs. By all appearances, the former kingdom of dwarves turned into a kind of Zaporizhian Sich. I am sure that not just orcs were finding a shelter there: deserters, criminals, runaway convicts and other desperate rabble were getting an affectionate reception by the Great and Terrible One. It may very well be that some dwarves continued to live there. And in the hierarchy of Moria, the place they occupied was not even nearly the lowest one.

The thing is, gentlemen, that Moria itself is not self-sustaining. A very extensive supply of food is required. Robbery does not provide it, there only remains trade. I can not explain the existence of Moria except by trading in underground minerals. With whom did the despicable orcs have barter deals? Not with elves!

Not just with elves, gentlemen, but with the elves of Lorien!

This is not a vile insinuation, the Master himself points this out very subtly and elegantly. There, where the Fellowship left Moria and met the elves of the Golden Wood. Prepare yourself for a machine-gun burst of quotes — the question is serious enough...

*"Late in the night he awoke... The Elves were gone... A little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on the ground below. There was a ring of metal. The sounds died slowly away, and seemed to go southward, on into the wood."* (LotR, Book II, Ch. 6) And in the same place: (Haldir to Frodo) *"I dared not arouse any cries... A strong company of Orcs has passed... The three of us could not challenge a hundred. (!)"*

You know, I'm not an expert in sabotage and reconnaissance, but one does not walk around like that in a hostile forest! Moreover, all this stomping and laughter has a very deliberate feel to it, to make it audible from afar, otherwise it will not be long until one gets hit with an arrow. This hundred of orcs is not a combat unit. They are, rather, policemen following criminals, who in the heat of the pursuit crossed the border of their state. But not to worry, because an agreement on the extradition of criminals is signed with the neighbors... And then also: *"and they /Elves/ brought news, some of which Haldir **reported**. The marauding orcs had been waylaid and almost all destroyed; the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains, and were being pursued."* Fast forward a half of the book, and: *"We have come all the way from the Mines to kill, and avenge our folk. I wish to kill, and then go back north."* (a conversation between the orcs who captured Merry and Pippin, LotR, Book III, Ch. 3) Do you feel it? From the Mines! "From Moria" may not pass through censorship. Aren't they our orcs who were "destroyed" in Lorien? Ours, ours! And Tolkien very beautifully and in a terribly secretive way informs us about it. He hopes that we will simply count them in the same chapter, "Uruk-hai." I am giving the necessary figures in the author's order.

1) *"The Hobbits were left with the Isengarders: a grim dark band, four score at least..."*
2) *"... and there was Grishnak again, and at his back a couple of score of others like him: long-armed crook-legged Orcs. They had a red eye painted on their shields."*

As if to confuse someone, the Professor does not name the number of Morian Orcs, but he gives the total:

3) *"Many orcs had fallen, but fully two hundred remained"*... Well, you can subtract yourself, I hope... Of course, the numbers are approximate, we should also take into account the ones fallen from the Boromir's sword, Rohan arrows and simply in internal brawls, but the result is still the same: the number of Morian orcs who entered the Golden Wood and of the ones who attacked Frodo at the falls of Rauros coincides — it's a hundred.

To me personally, all this is more than enough. I can almost see what is going on in the Golden Wood, while Frodo is sitting in a tree, afraid to move... I'm not sure I'll be able to reproduce the style of the Master, but I'll try...

"...— What are you doing here, morons?" — a whistling whisper was heard from the bushes.

"Haldir?" — the leader hissed uncertainly, stepping forward. When he recognized the elf, he grinned with his toothy maw:

"Hello, old monkey! Have not fallen from a tree yet... Look, we're trying to catch a gang here... Some eight deft guys dispatched heaps of our men in the caves. Everything is covered with blood there. They went your way. I say, want to hunt together?..

— What hunt! Get lost, quickly! Guys, there is such politics involved here that they will write off you and me both without batting an eye. Take them at Rauros, they'll pass there. But make sure it does not even stink of you around here.

— Is it really so serious? Fine, if you say at Rauros then at Rauros... By the way, Hal, is the bracelet for my girl ready yet? Every day she pesters me..."

* * *

Moria and Lorien lived in a great friendship, gentlemen, and this friendship was not only economical but also military-strategical in nature. Do you not find it strange that, sitting under the very nose of Sauron, the Lords of the Golden Wood show astonishing disdain for all potential allies. Both in Rohan and in Gondor they are treated, to put it mildly, with distrust. And what if Mordor wins? Little Lorien will not last long. One does not need to be a great strategist to realize this. There can only be one explanation for such carelessness: Lorien is not going to fight — it is going to retreat. Not through the Rohan steppes, not through the valley of Isen (after the fall of Gondor they will be quickly captured by Sauron) and certainly not over the Misty Mountains, but *under them.* Through the same warm and dry Moria tunnels, inaccessible to the Lord of Mordor. What kind of safeguards from a treachery of orcs the Lords had, I cannot imagine. But these safeguards were certainly super-reliable! And the Balrog... I think during the time of the evacuation, he would hide in some very deep crack, since elves learned how to beat up his kind way back in the First Age...

But why am I going on about Moria and Moria again... Other orc settlements are no less interesting. Each of them owes its existence to **treachery.** But no, a treachery of such scale requires a dirtier epithet — it's **politics...**


### Dol Guldur

This fortress sticks out like a nail in the middle of elven lands. Any sensible commander would have destroyed it, regardless of the losses. It is absolutely not logical! And yet, its existence can be explained. By the existence of a **peace treaty** between elves and Sauron! (Perhaps this also explains the fact that orcs, sometimes killing elves, do not take trophies. Too obvious of an evidence of a ceasefire violation.) I'm sure that any orc perceived the appointment to the garrison of Dol Guldur as a tour to a sanatorium. There are only peaceful elves around and not a single horrible, bloodthirsty tark. But what is much more interesting, in my opinion, is not the existence, but the formation of Dol Guldur of the War of the Rings era. I really do not want to, but I must type a long quote from the Book...

*"I myself dared to pass the doors of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur... he was none other than Sauron... Some, too, will remember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him, and for long we watched him only. Yet at last, as his shadow grew, Saruman yielded, and the Council put forth its strength and drove the evil out of Mirkwood...*

*But we were too late, as Elrond foresaw. Sauron also had watched us... Then he gave way before us, but only feigned to flee, and soon after came to the Dark Tower and openly declared himself."* (LotR, Book II, Ch. 2)

Gandalf is again bending the truth. As a jailbird during an interrogation, he blames everything on a "deadman", that is on Saruman. This could be believable if, when "the Council drove the evil out of Mirkwood," Dol Guldur would have been destroyed. But there are too many "coulds" and "woulds"... After the flight of Sauron, the fortress was not burned to the ground. I would not be surprised if it was even repaired. And only ten years later (in 2951) — *"Sauron sends three of the Nazgul to reoccupy Dol Guldur."* (LotR, Appendix B) It is impossible to step on the same rake several times. There is something else at play here. Elven Lords were interested in the existence of this hotbed of orcs. It's my stupid habit of looking everywhere for Earth analogies, but it reminds me very much of the flying school near Kaluga where Luftwaffe pilots were trained before the Second World War. According to the Treaty of Versailles, Germany could not have an army and, especially, prepare officers. Wehrmacht officers were trained in the Soviet Union. Stalin was training a wolfhound to set it on the West. Everyone knows what came of it...

And now a very similar wolfhound is gaining strength in Mirkwood. Gandalf is a frequent visitor there, by the way! Two of his visits to Dol Guldur were officially recorded: in 2063 (*"Sauron retreats and hides in the East."* — LotR, Appendix B) and in 2850 (when Gandalf *"... discovers that its master is indeed Sauron... finds Thrain and receives the key of Erebor"* — ibid.) Don't you think that old boy Gan felt very uninhibited in the heart of the enemy? Could he call on there with inspections? In this case, he knew from the very beginning who the owner of Dol Guldur was, but just as in the story with the Ring, he pretends to be dumb and feigns dementia. Apparently, after losing the Ring, Sauron danced for a long time to the elven whistle, and, by the way, not for the first time. And he was saving up strength. He was given the role of the counterweight to Gondor. Do you know when Shadow first covered Greenwood and it got the name Mirkwood? In 1050. And it was that year when the King of Gondor, Hyarmendacil **conquered Harad.** The empire reaches the peak of power. Do you still consider Gondor to be innocuous? Elves did not.

That legendary campaign against Dol Guldur, from which Saruman was dissuading everyone, did not at all intend to destroy Sauron. The wolf grew and matured, it was the time to pay for the feed. Sauron was forced into Mordor, closer to the "probable" enemy. And Dol Guldur was left in reserve. And it came in handy...

There is one serious, at the first glance, problem in the history of the War of the Rings. In two most important battles, at Pelennor and at Cormallen, not a single elven detachment participated. And this is despite all the hysterical cries of the Firstborn about the common threat from the East, despite all the calls to unite and fight back the Enemy! We understand that in the Third Age elves preferred to be propagandists, not soldiers, but how would you explain it to the allies. And the opportunity to do so was provided by the formidable and terrible fortress of Dol Guldur.

On March 11, 3019, four days before the Pelennor battle, serene vacations of the Dol Guldur garrison ended. Angry officers woke up sleepy, fattened orcs with kicks and drove them... *to storm Lorien.* When attacking most of the typical fortresses, the main task is to overcome the defensive perimeter, or, simply put, the walls. But Lorien is a unique place. This "fortress" is *completely* composed of the defensive perimeter, and the number of watchtowers in it coincides with the number of trees. Storming such a monster without artillery is a suicide! And the numerical superiority of the attackers is difficult for me, a wretched one, to even imagine. But orcs still attack Lorien! And, of course, they crack their foreheads. But on March 15 they swarm again, and not just Celeborn, but also the other side — Thranduil! A week later — the *third* attack on the Golden Wood! My first thought was that they had overdone fly agarics. But if you look at the situation more closely, the strategic convulsions of Dol Guldur become much more meaningful. The fact is that after the invasion of Mordor in the valley of Osgiliath, when the fate of Gondor hung in the balance, both Thranduil, and, especially, Celeborn were *obliged* to send military aid to Denethor. If before the aggravation of the military conflict they could still somehow evade participation in battles, at the decisive moment their presence on the battlefield was compulsory. The Lords needed an extremely convincing reason to not get into this massacre. A "doctor's note" of a kind. And Sauron understands this perfectly. He does not need elves under Minas Tirith either. He gives Lorien what it silently begs for — an imitation of an assault. Of course, he cannot send kamikazes from Mordor, where every fighter is worth his weight in gold, but Dol Guldur is just right for this purpose. And when at the edge of the Golden Wood, under the blows from catapults, the Mallorns begin to fall, the Lords sigh with relief... *Forgive us, Denethor, we would be happy to help, but we are in a bind ourselves — had to fight off three attacks in two weeks...*

On March 25, 3019, Sauron fell, and the fortress of Dol Guldur served its last purpose. Three days later, on March 28, Celeborn crossed Anduin and took the "impregnable" fortress immediately. Lorien archers still had river water squishing in their boots. I sincerely hope that during those three days the bulk of the garrison managed to disperse, and there were not too many corpses. To all of the Lord's titles, one more had been added: "A veteran of the War of the Rings". Now no one would dare call him a "swivel-chair warrior", because, damn it, he took Dol Guldur, the most gloomy, insidious and ridiculous fortress of Middle-earth!


### Mordor

Let us return back in time when Sauron hastily left Dol Guldur and turned up in Mordor. This area does not seem like a world leader's headquarters at all. It is more like a place of exile. A terribly bleak and, most importantly, an infertile place. Hordes of orcs, fleeing there from the global genocide, are simply forced to attack richer areas located around. And with the advent of Sauron, the number of orcs in Mordor had increased manyfold. Regardless of whatever elves were ingeminating about the fear and horror with which Sauron achieves obedience, in the eyes of the savage peoples of Middle-earth and, first and foremost, orcs, he was a protector, a uniter, and a Chieftain. Genghis Khan, if you wish. According to the elves' plan, the Mordorian horde had to restrain the imperial ambitions of Gondor, and the rich Mordorian environment — the growth of the horde itself. But at that point, there was a mishap. Sown seeds began to rise too fast. The soil turned out to be fertile! But fertilizers for this soil, strangely enough, were introduced by Gondor. For centuries, this country waged aggressive wars with the surrounding peoples. A kind of Rome. With its arrogance, wealth, military power and **slavery.** The Dunlendings, the Easterlings, the Umbar seamen and, of course, Harad felt nothing but hatred for the Gondor Empire. In my opinion, it was Harad that played the main role in supplying Mordor with food. They fed it but did not let it into the house. Harad had not given shelter to a single Mordor pack. Farmers do not like nomads. Nevertheless, they fought together on the Pelennor and Cormallen fields. *"...saw the ruin of their war... and yet were men proud and bold, in their turn now gathered themselves for a last stand of desperate battle."* (LotR, Book VI, Ch. 4) This courage Tolkien explains by the fact that *"...the men Rhun and of Harad, Easterlings and Southron... were deepest and longest in evil servitude, hating the West..."* In principle, I agree...


### Isengard

It may appear that Saruman's orcs are a random phenomenon and do not deserve close attention. Indeed, they were erased from the face of Middle-earth in the course of the Battle of Helm's Deep alone. The love of power and perfidy of Saruman created them, and it also destroyed them. Their problem was that their lord was a magnificent schemer, but a terrible commander. And yet... It is the Isengard Orcs, in my opinion, who made a step forward in terms of the military development. While Sauron for centuries simply raked scattered tribes into a pile and threw them into the meat grinder, not caring much about military training, Saruman made literate, disciplined soldiers out of nomads. In Isengard, unlike Mordor, there is no fear of the master. Only devotion. By the way, it is devotion and, if you like, loyalty to the oath that raises orcs over other peoples of Middle-earth. It is their inherent feature.

Saruman's attempt to play his own game is not so ridiculous as it may seem. His main asset was the unique geographical location of Isengard. And the second trump card was given to him on a platter by the very same elves. During what time, do you think, the 10,000-strong army of Isengard was gathered, trained and staffed? (*"'... there must have been ten thousand at the very least,' Merry continued."* — Lotr, Book III, Ch. 9) Well, let's say three years! Although, of course, this is ridiculous. (Saruman began to fortify Isengard in 2953, 64 years before the events described, see Appendix B to LotR) But even with such a frenzied pace of Saruman, old boy Gandalf should retire, and the chief of the elven intelligence service should be court-martialed. It's a war crime, gentlemen, to miss such a crowd of orcs right under your nose! And Saruman himself? How did he dare to start mobilization, knowing that at any moment his whole venture might be discovered! There is only one answer — he was doing his shady business with the full **knowledge** and **approval** of the White Council. The Isengard army was to serve as a barrier in the way of Sauron in the event of the defeat of Gondor. And in case of victory... In case of victory, I am afraid that the kings of Gondor would first have to think about this new threat from the west... The reason for this monkey business is that with the death of Gil-galad there were no strong elven states left in Middle-earth. If we consider the distribution of political forces, regardless of whatever Gandalf and co declared about peace and friendship between nations, it was elves who benefited most from the mutual thousand-year massacre of Gondor and Mordor. While there are two strong enemies in the world who hate each other, elves can set aside sailing over the Sea.

Such a "spare" enemy for Gondor was created by Saruman in Isengard. Gil-galad would spin in his coffin, but times change — and morals change with them. Unfortunately, Saruman had his own plans for this army. The tactical training failed. "The mountain has moved — it will be destroyed."

Strictly speaking, here we can stop discussing Saruman, but I want to draw your attention to one episode. Remember the strange orc who wounded Frodo with a spear in Moria? *"...he turned Boromir's sword and bore him backwards... Diving under Aragorn's blow with the speed of a striking snake etc."* (LotR, Book II, Ch. 5) The fact is that this is not a Morian orc. Morian orcs, given the aforesaid, were very weak fighters. They lacked practice. The warrior who hit Frodo with a spear differs from them like a wolf from a lap dog. As many signs attest, he is an emissary of Saruman. What was he doing in Moria? Recruited soldiers to the army of Isengard? Was he negotiating a military alliance? Or waiting for the Fellowship? I do not know. But he possessed information that orcs of Moria could not have — information about a halfling carrying something very, very important... The equipment and agility of this orc are admirable. And his mad courage, readiness to meet death to carry out an order... It is for Isengard orcs that these qualities are more characteristic than for the ones from Mordor. Why did he charge into the room alone? I think he was pushed by the Morian rabble, who was cowering by the door in fear. *"Hey, Isengardian, maybe show us what you're capable of?!"* And as a proud officer of the Isengard Army, he had no right to remain alive. By the way, it is possible that the whole attack on the Fellowship was provoked by the orcs of Saruman the Wise.

* * *

In conclusion of this topic, there are several thoughts about the origin of orcs. The version of elven roots does not really convince me. On the other hand, the combination of attributes: tirelessness, the ability to run long distances, an amazing sense of smell, a unique understanding with wolves and, **most importantly,** sticking out the tongue when it's hot, (i.e., the orcs lack sweat glands — by sticking out their tongue they create an evaporation surface for cooling the body, like dogs) suggests the wolf origin of these amazing creatures... (Hee-hee) However, the information is too scarce, and experimental research is difficult, so this question remains unanswered...


## Chapter 2, the biggest one. On elves, rings and other things


### On rings

...How many miles to Avalon? None, I say, and all... What distinguishes elves and men? Death, and that's it. They can marry each other and "give fertile offspring." This property means that elves and men are one biological species. If you do not believe me, look in a school biology textbook (Genetics). Death, the Gift of Men, is pounded into a man such that even a culture of cells lives and multiplies for somewhere around 60 divisions, after which it perishes. Completely. As if a switch has been clicked... But what if we imagine for a moment that a group of people has discovered the secret of immortality... They are simply forced to "introduce themselves" as other beings! *Elves do not age? What can you do — a special kind of organism! Ah, so they are men?! **I want it too!!!** Keeping silent, you bastard? Let's go to the rack, chum!..* Fortunately, they did not learn genetics in Middle-earth, otherwise elves would face genocide, in comparison to which Auschwitz..., sorry, I got carried away... It seems very likely that the Firstborn could extend not only their own life. And this gave them a huge trump card in politics. Any king knew that you can live longer if you do not drink too much wine, exercise, observe moderation in sex, and, most importantly, **be friends with elves**.

But there is one more aspect. This "small" biological difference between the two peoples leads to differences in psychology, in politics, in science, in the worldview... and in the devil knows what else! And, of course, in the ways of progress. A man hurries and invents — an elf observes and comprehends the very essence of phenomena and objects. And he improves his body, soul, and hidden abilities. He just has an unlimited supply of time for this. As a result, the thing we call **magic** becomes available to an elf. Interestingly, the "magic" of Tolkien is fundamentally different from the "magic" of other fantasy writers. It is more shifted towards modern parapsychology. Gandalf, for example, flaunted fire and lightning only twice or thrice. On the level of an infantryman with a flamethrower, at that. (And considering that he is a specialist in pyrotechnics...) And he cannot catch his breath for four pages after that. Much more often and more skillfully he heals, raises morale, removes illusions and the evil eye of some Saruman. The magic of Sauron and the Nazgul does not exhibit external effects at all — just moods, nothing more... Although I got distracted...

However, because of the infinite existence, several serious "inconveniences" arise.

1. Informational supersaturation.

The smallest of the problems. It can not be solved completely, but it is quite realistic to delay it considerably. A man is unlikely to ever come close to the methods of memory improvement and training that elves have developed for millennia. The musicality and poetry of the Firstborn, perhaps, is an echo of these techniques. I would not be surprised if elves even thought in verse. Judge for yourself, you remember the poem learned in the third grade perfectly, but completely forgot the law of Pascal, learned in the seventh grade...

2. Emotional fatigue.

This is scarier. In this problem lies the reason for the slow withering of the elven people. No matter how young Galadriel and Celeborn looked — they were old men at their hearts. And such immortal elders sat on the thrones of all elven states! As a result: inert, conservative politics and plain cowardice, called caution. Absolutely all the elven kings sought to self-isolate (excluding Elrond Half-elven, but then he is not an elf at all). Hide in a hole, surround yourself with impregnable mountains, the Girdle of Melian etc, but preserve tranquility, serenity and **permanence.** At any cost! Such a strategy sooner or later ends with a catastrophe, it is enough to recall medieval Japan or, well, I'll just say it, USSR.

But it is equally important to consider emotional fatigue in terms of creativity. It is no other than elves who are known as the greatest Masters of Arts of Middle-earth, and by right! But all the ingenious works were created by **young** elves. By those who had not lost the ability to wonder and the desire to surprise others. With time, it goes away. Feanor was not bending the truth when he said that he could not create the Silmarils a second time. As an artist, he reached the pinnacle of creativity, he created his masterpiece, which means an irrevocable, or at least very long, devastation. The expression "put your heart into it" is literal! *"Therefore we will neither give them nor sell them /ships/ for any league or friendship. For I say to you, Feanor son of Finwe, these are to us as are the gems of the Noldor: the work of our hearts, whose like we shall not make again."* (Silmarillion, Ch. 9)

Forgive me for such a long and boring introduction, but it is absolutely necessary because it was precisely in this "creative" point that Sauron struck! He gave elves the idea of ​​the rings.

And elves woke up. A thousand-year hibernation ended! An old man turned into a young man in love. Horizons hitherto unseen have been revealed. In short, Sauron gave back their youth to elves. And in an atmosphere of universal excitement and glee, no one realized that the elven dominion was over. If you want an eagle to forget how to fly, give it a helicopter. Having created the magic mechanisms of the rings, Sauron not only initiated the degradation of elves in terms of magic but also broke their **monopoly** on magic.

All the information about the nature of the rings is contained in a few very stunted expressions: *"bind them"* (LotR, Book I, Ch. 2), *"the Ring's power grew"* (LotR, Book VI, Ch. 1), *"Though he was getting restless and uneasy. Thin and stretched he said."* (LotR, Book I, Ch. 2), *"... in the end it would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it."* (LotR, Book I, Ch. 2) /I could not find the last quote the author used, so I had to settle for a close one that also supports his theory — *translator.*/ etc. But even on such a loose foundation one can build, I think, certain quite realistic assumptions, namely:

The Rings of Power were a system for accumulation and transfer (I do not know where) of a certain substance, which, in my ignorance, I have to call magical energy. They pulled it from the environment, from the owner, from wherever... What is important is that Middle-earth was so "vampired off" that by the beginning of the War of the Rings, magic was concentrated in the Rings almost entirely. Well, maybe wizards managed to tuck away a little. Of course, the owner of the Ring, if he was strong enough, could use a part of its power for his own purposes, but, well, one can also fry eggs on a nuclear reactor... By the way, it seems that Saruman the Wise foresaw the disappearance of the magical power in Middle-earth. It's not without reason that he engaged in mechanics so persistently and, judging by some signs, even reached the steam engine. Should have sat this one out, poor bustler...

It makes sense to refresh in memory the history of the creation of the Rings.

According to the chronicles of the Second Age, elves began the mass production of them around 1500. "Repentant" Sauron wandered peacefully in Eregion (nonetheless, he was not allowed into Lindon), rubbed his hands and gently reproved *"Gil-galad... and **Master Elrond**"* for, supposedly, not believing... not liking... Those timid whimpers consisted of one hundred percent poison. When the English King Edward III, claiming the French crown, ordered to depict lilies on his coat of arms, it was the cause of the Hundred Years War... I am afraid to imagine those explosions of thousand-year arrogance in Gil-galad and Celebrimbor that were caused by Sauron's whispers. *Half-blood is equated with the Lords! There is no smoke without fire! What is he aiming at?!! And what of the neighbor himself? Could he get him to do that?..* etc, etc. As a result, Elrond is in disgrace, and there is cold and ice between Lindon and Eregion... But I digress, let's return to the rings.

The manufacture of the rings continued in Eregion for a hundred years. Three rings were forged by Celebrimbor in 1590. And Sauron forged his own in another ten years — in 1600. In the same year, by the way, he finishes building Barad-dur. He's already got **everything** ready for war!

Apparently, in his work, the Lord of Eregion deviated significantly from the "developer's blueprints", and Sauron could not create a full-fledged magical network. But nevertheless, he feels like the master of the situation. The magic of elves is blocked! *"Lend me the rings — I need to adjust something,"* he politely asks. *"Never!"* elves answer proudly. *"Oh, guys, how are you going to get away **now**..."* And in 1693 he starts a war. Pay attention, almost two centuries after the release of the first products... Within four years, Eregion is captured, the Lord is killed, and all the rings (except for the Three) are in possession of Sauron. And Sauron slowly distributes them... *(With the ratio of 3:7:9. I do not know what these figures say from the numerological point of view. I see in this an attempt to equalize the magical potential of all races based on the principle of "whoever is more defective, gets more"...)*

In the same year 1697, *"The gates of Moria are shut."* (LotR, Appendix B) Perhaps the last thing Celebrimbor saw before he was captured was his own inscription made of ithildin on the closed gates... How come, dwarves? Was the fear of the Enemy so powerful that you hid in the hole? Alas! The friend and the teacher was not abandoned in a moment of weakness but sold out for seven magic trinkets. However, this we will discuss later...


#### Nine

For me personally, the most interesting event takes place in three years, in 1700. The eleventh king of Numenor Tar-Minastir leads a huge fleet to Lindon, and Sauron **surrenders!** Evidently, this is a worthy capitulation, because Sauron is expelled from Eregion only in a **hundred** years! Apparently, he swore a vassal oath to the Numenoreans, and they calmed down... By the way, fourteen centuries later Sauron repeats the same trick with Ar-Pharazon the Golden. He was so afraid of death that he declared war on the Valar...

Tar-Minastir was also afraid of death, but for him there happened to be... a ring, one of the Nine! You must agree, it is difficult to imagine a gift more valuable and more worthy for your victor. Too simple, in your opinion? Correct! The name of the Witch-king is not even hidden — it is lightly sprinkled with leaves from those who skim through in a hurry. And why even hide it? Well, firstly, he is a distant ancestor of Aragorn and can tarnish the name of the Great Hero, and secondly, more importantly, **legally** he had much more rights to both the Gondorian and Arnorian Thrones than the same Aragorn. And his war against these countries, you must agree, appears in a slightly different light.

Just to disguise this name, the dates of life of Numenorean kings are given with large gaps /In the Appendices to LotR; they are given explicitly in Unfinished Tales, which were released after Tolkien's death and edited by his son. — *translator.*/. The simplest arithmetic comes to the rescue. Elros Tar-Minyatur, Elrond's brother, lived for 550 years, the longest of all the dynasty. Known are the dates of the ascension to the throne of the second king, Vardamir, (442) and the seventh queen Tar-Ancalime (1075). That is, the average time of the reign of the five rulers is approximately 122 years. I emphasize, only reign, not life. The thirteenth, Tar-Atanamir receives the scepter in 2251 /According to LotR, Appendix B; Unfinished Tales quotes 2029. Talk about Eldar censorship! — *translator.*/. By the way, in the same year the Nazgul were first noticed! And the nineteenth king, Ar-Adunakhor starts his reign in 2899. These six kings ruled for an average of 108 years. That's right, their life expectancy was decreasing.

Tar-Minastir, the eleventh king, as follows from these calculations, ascended the throne around 1580, some twenty years before the manufacture of the One Ring (and apparently began the war with Sauron at a very old age, almost on a deathbed). The twelfth one was Tar-Ciryatan. So, this couple ruled for the total of 670 years, 335 each! Do you feel the reek of the Nazgul? And it is not the twelfth king, since: *"These things took place in the days of **Tar-Ciryatan** the Shipbuilder, and of Tar-Atanamir his son..."* (Silmarillion, "The downfall of Numenor") If Ciryatan was a ring-bearer, the son would not last until the end of his reign, at best it would be a grandson! *"The first sign of the shadow that was to fall upon them appeared in the days of Tar-Minastir, eleventh king."* (LotR, Appendix A) — the Professor hints us unobtrusively. Some first signs: "it blackened and fell off"... However, if this is not enough — I give up...


#### Seven

Dwarven rings were the weakest — they did not even give immortality to their owner. And that's almost all that is known about them. Perhaps the Professor did not have enough time, maybe I did not find some important books, or maybe they are just not translated to Russian. But in for a penny — start praising your swamp. The lack of information can also be information... *Analyze and do not buzz!*

And what do we have on dwarves at all? Some intelligence on them appears in The Tale of Years only in the middle of the Third Age. Three thousand years have passed since the distribution of the rings...

There were Seven Fathers of dwarves, who gave rise to the seven clans. The number of the rings was also seven. It is self-evident that Sauron made a gift to the king of every clan... But all the information about dwarves in the Book concerns only the Durin's Folk. In principle, you can wash your hands of the entire matter and refuse to work with such scarce material. But there is a crazy hypothesis...

We do not know which of the kings specifically Sauron handed the rings. We do not know when he took three of them back. We do not know when three rings were destroyed by dragons. Only a few words are said about the ring of Thrain, the father of Thorin Oakenshield. In the year 2845 of the Third Age in the dungeon of Dol Guldur Sauron takes it away from the captive king. Five years later, Gandalf appears in Dol Guldur, finds Thrain in the dungeon and receives from him a secret key to the Lonely Mountain. In the same year, Thrain dies. From old age, from torture, or, perhaps, *from excessive knowledge... Stop, Pronin! Enough rummaging in the mud! Just tell me peacefully how the ring got to Thrain himself.*

To the king of Erebor Thrain II, the last ring came from an ancestor ten generations back, Durin VI, the Sovereign of Moria. The Balrog, yes, yes, the same one, killed Durin. But the tsar apparently managed to pass the ring to his son Nain. But only a year later, the bastard Balrog killed Nain too! But he, of course, managed to pass the Treasure to his son, Thrain I. No one killed the next six generations of dwarven kings. But Dain I was slain by a dragon! But the ring, of course, is already in Thror's possession... Such sagacity and deftness of the rulers are very easy to explain if they kept the Ring, say, in a trunk. But for some reason, it seems to me that they did not part with it even in bed. At least, I would personally wear it on a chain, like Frodo. It can also be explained in another way. There was more than one ring in Moria! I even think — **all of them!** Sauron did not skimp — he strewed from the heart. Perhaps he wanted to cause envy to Khazad Dum among other kings. Or rather, it was a fee for betraying Celebrimbor. One does not exclude the other. And the rings began to pump "magic energy" from the surrounding space. And it was this that led to the awakening of the Balrog. He became uncomfortable, some weakness came in tides, and so on... While he was figuring it out, thousands of years had passed... But then he went hunting and let off steam. And destroyed the rings along with the kings. The Balrog, not a dragon!.. And what do you think, gentlemen! A thousand years pass, and again, one fine evening, the same symptoms! And much stronger now. Then again, he is already experienced — he knows where the wind blows... So he reacted instantly! Only he ran into a mage, not a dwarf. What a bummer...

But, alas, this is only a hypothesis...


#### Three

They were forged by Celebrimbor. Sauron's hand did not touch them — they were clean, they were not linked in the chain, so I'm not particularly interested in them. That's all.

* * *

But the storm that was raised in Middle-earth by the "junior" rings is in no way comparable to the hurricane of the "senior" one...


#### The Ruling Ring

In "The Last Ring-bearer", Eskov expresses a very curious idea that Sauron's Ring is nothing but a giant hoax. It was made with only one purpose — to bang together the heads of the kings of Rohan and Gondor, and this venture failed. I really like this version, but unfortunately, the way the author presents it, it sounds more like a postulate, and not a proven theorem.

I agree with Eskov in one thing: the military significance of the Ring was greatly exaggerated. With the Ring, Sauron did not win **a single** campaign! Twice he bowed his head to the Numenoreans and was once defeated at Dagorlad by the forces of the Last Alliance. Moreover, *with the Ring on his finger,* Sauron was defeated by a man (Elendil) in a **single combat!**

The most beautiful hypothesis about the purpose of this object was expressed by one of my friends (by the way, a Dark one). He suggested that the Ring teleported magical energy... **to Melkor!** This hypothesis can not be refuted. Unfortunately, it is impossible to prove it either, and therefore, I come back down to Arda...

There is one absolutely inexplicable property in the Ruling Ring that is not inherent to others. It is the only one that suits the definition of "jewelry". The three elven rings, for example, are completely invisible. Indeed, such devices should be kept away from prying eyes. Sauron's ring is on display! Greed and lust it causes in others. And this property, apparently, the creator hammered into it consciously. When you own such a thing, one should shy away not only from "his foes" — but from "his friends" as well. And if you remember the highly pronounced "vampiric" characteristics... You will laugh in my face, gentlemen, but Sauron did not create the Ring **for himself**. (By the way, it lacks a stone. Could he think of asking for someone's hand, that old stump?) And yet he carried it on his finger! What's the matter? Was the gift not accepted? Or did he fall in his own trap? No matter how stupid it sounds, I lean towards the latter guess.

Eventually, Isildur helped the unlucky creator get rid of his obsession. And the Ring got out into the big world.

Isildur enjoyed the trophy for only two years. On the way to Arnor, he falls into an ambush of orcs. This event takes place on the shore of Gladden river, north of Lorien. The place of the tragedy itself raises suspicions. And the whole story stinks so much that one should open a criminal case. First of all, the amazing carelessness of both "the dark ones" and "the light ones" is incomprehensible. Imagine that a shot down secret plane fell into a swamp. The swamp will be drained to the bottom so that not a single screw is lost! And the place of Isildur's death was known perfectly by orcs! Elves, too, could narrow it down with an accuracy of one meter. But neither of them even lifted a finger to find the Ruling Ring!..

In Silmarillion, Isildur's death is described in great detail. *"Isildur himself escaped by means of the Ring... but the Orcs hunted him by scent and slot."* (Silmarillion, "Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age") What nonsense! Boromir threshed two dozen orcs without any Ring! I think Isildur was not inferior to him in terms of military training. Being invisible, such a warrior is simply invincible! I do not believe that Isildur, before whose eyes his three sons (Elendur, Aratan, and Ciryon) had just died, would try to save his own hide. And the shooting "by smell" only a baby would swallow /The author is misled here by a translation error: evidently, the Russian translators misread "hunted him by scent and slot" (i.e., by his tracks) as "hunted him by scent and shot". — *translator.*/. The further, the weirder! The invisible man darted into the river, and they saw him only when the Ring slipped off! Think about it! The invisible king could do anything but go into the water. Because he would have been noticed well **before** the Ring fell off.

And where did all these details even come from? Because there were no witnesses... Oh, pardon me. There were! *"Only three of his people came ever back over the mountains after long wandering; and of these one was Ohtar his esquire, to whose keeping he had given the shards of the sword of Elendil."* (ibid.) Apparently, Ohtar "saw" his master running towards the river, and then swimming. What was he, hiding in the bushes or running after him? And why did he go to Rivendell, and not to Gondor, to Isildur's nephew, King Meneldil? Afraid of the "official investigation"? How did he dare to appear before the wife of his master (she lived with the younger son in Imladris) after his death? After all, the squire is more than a bodyguard! He is the one who is entrusted with the weapon, the one who must put this weapon in the hand of his master, even if he is dead **himself!** For any squire of all times and peoples, the greatest shame is to survive the death of his master in battle and then to come back home after this... If this happens — flee, change your name! Let them think that you are killed, otherwise all your kin will be doused with mud. Ohtar, how did you even dare come to Imladris?!.

Everything falls into place if... Isildur **did not put the ring on!** He could make such a decision only in one case. If this was a death sentence, if the attackers were led by... a Ring-bearer! Running to the river, Isildur tried not to save himself, but to have time to hide the Ring before his death.

*"Give back the Ring, Isildur." — "Sorry, chum, but I don't have it!" — "And this we're going to check now!"... "Wow, you really don't!"*

The ring did not fall to the bottom of the river by itself — Isildur drowned it **on purpose!** How many arrows were already in him when he unclenched his fist? I do not know... But he fulfilled his duty. The ring did not fall into the wrong hands. Nobody even looked for it in Gladden! After all, only a fool would not try to save himself, having such a trump card! Those who killed him, who spread the rumor about the "treachery" of the Ring, deceived themselves. The squire Ohtar, who bought his life with perjury, did not come to Rivendell — he was **brought** there. But the most important thing he did not tell the killers: that the Ring *really* lies at the bottom of Gladden river.

Isildur signed his death sentence on the Plateau of Gorgoroth, by refusing to throw the Ring in the Mount Doom. And the executor of this verdict could only be one *Ring-bearer* — Elrond Half-elven. It was to him that the highborn mother-in-law dumped all the dirty work. This is a very serious accusation on my part, but I am sure of it thanks to Ohtar, the one who, according to the plan, was supposed to whitewash elves...

Did Sauron even know the story of Isildur's death? Certainly! And he rubbed his hands. Quite logically, he was expecting the Ring to reach the addressee (or the customer?). Having learned that this thing is in the Shire in the possession of some hobbit, he was, to put it mildly, upset. And a new story began!

"...Terribly looking monstrosities grabbed the poor child..." /A quote from a verse by Sergey Mikhalkov — *translator.*/ The horror envelops me when I recall the Nazgul following Frodo on his heels! Judging by this episode, Sauron had developed had a good sense of humor. "Do you want to have a good time, guys?" — he asks the ghosts. "Sure thing!" — they reply. "Then go ahead! But the main thing is to be loud and scary! Ooh-ooh-ooh, and all that."

*"I cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again..."* Aragorn mumbles at Weathertop after Frodo had been injured. Indeed, the balance of power — five **Nazgul** against four **hobbits** (one already wounded) and a Dunedain! The reason they retreated, dear Aragorn, is that the Nazgul had no order to take the Ring. The order was to drive it into Rivendell! And all this chase with smoke and noise is a typical work of beaters, not hunters.

And the Ring gets to Rivendell! Do the Lords understand what a pig in a poke they had got? Undoubtedly! If even I have deduced the "vampiric" nature of the Ring, then so have the Wise. This toy is designed for a fight against elves and *only elves!* But the purpose of the meeting organized in Rivendell is to convince the participants of the **universal** threat.

I have given the council of Elrond enough attention, but I would like to dwell on one inconspicuous moment of the discussion. The proposal to send the Ring to Valinor. Of course, such a possibility should also be considered, evaluated and **discarded!** The proposal came from Glorfindel. (Gloin tenses. Gimli squeezes his ax) Elrond protests: *"And they who dwell beyond the Sea would not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to Middle-earth; it is for us who still dwell here to deal with it."* (The dwarves relax) It is noteworthy that nobody intervenes in the unhurried dialogue of the elves. **Everybody** is fine with this ridiculous explanation, even in a hypothetical form! Perhaps, when driving Frodo into Rivendell, Sauron counted on this "export" option as the most desired. To pump out magic from Valinor — what could be more beautiful?! It did not work out. As it turned out later, elves have analyzed the situation much better than the ruler of Mordor and made a move he did not foresee. They went for a mutual defeat — the destruction of the magic of Middle-earth.

And after the Fellowship left Rivendell, Sauron completely lost control of the situation.

On the way to Lorien, nobody expected any special adventures. But out of nowhere, the Balrog appeared. At first glance, an unfortunate accident. The Pippin's stone fell on his head etc... In principle, this episode could be omitted, but the fact is, gentlemen, that the Balrog crawled out for the Ring! I do not know how he felt it, most likely, the Ring itself "attracted" him (you must agree, a glorious trophy for a magical vacuum cleaner). But Gandalf stood in the way of the Balrog. He tells him a few phrases. And what phrases! Two Maiar met on the Bridge of Khazad-Dum. One wants to stop the other, and his words must be very convincing! And besides, they must contain a password that confirms the strength and the power of the speaker. *"I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun."* /Again, a translation error led the author the wrong way. In Russian translation, the last sentence reads "The dark flame of Udun will not avail you." Nevertheless, the rest of the paragraph can still be salvaged, if we assume that "the dark fire" denoted the Ring and not "flame of Udun" as can be understood from the Russian translation. — *translator.*/ The key to this phrase may be on the map of Mordor. Udun is a small valley between Cirith Gorgor and the Isenmouthe in the north-west of Mordor. In about fifty miles to the south-east is Orodruin mountain. I do not pretend to have discovered the Truth, but I translate Gandalf's phrase as follows: "I am a servant of the Secret Flame *(I am a Maia, not weaker than you!)* And *(besides)* I wield the flame of Anor *(the Ring of Fire, Narya)*, the dark fire /"flame of Udun" in the original here — *translator.*/ *(the flame of Orodruin — the Ring of Sauron)* will not help you *(since you do not have it yet)*. Go back to the Shadow *(otherwise, you'll be sorry)*." The Balrog did not obey, and the Company arrived in Lorien without Gandalf. And there the most exquisite intrigue is weaved around the Ring...

The sequence of events that began in Lorien and ended at Rauros suggests that when the fate of the Ring was decided (no, not in Rivendell, but much earlier), two plans had been developed. Gandalf's plan and Galadriel's plan. Destruction and **conservation.** The latter scenario probably appealed to elves more than the former, because it allowed them to preserve the magical power and, consequently, delayed the emigration over the Sea for an indefinite period. Gandalf's side won, and I think, not without Elrond's support. And suddenly an unexpected turn of events! Gandalf, the head of the operation "Orodruin", leaves the game just when the Ring comes to Lorien. And Galadriel could not resist the temptation. She starts a solo performance! She improvises on the go! And, by God, it is breathtaking!

When the Fellowship was being created in Rivendell, the main stake was not made on military power, but on maneuverability and stealth. And, most importantly, on the *speed* of movement. By the way, the march through Moria was made with the aim to significantly shorten the way, that is, win in speed. Lorien was supposed to be a short stop. At best — refuel, catch on sleep, do laundry, take a bath and **that's it**! But the Fellowship is stuck in the Golden Wood for a **month!!!** From January 17 to February 16 (LotR, Appendix B). Until the very day when they sail out, they do not see the Lords. Nobody seems to be holding them. But tell me, how can a disciplined soldier take unauthorized leave during the execution of a task of the utmost importance? Fine, let's say the whole squad turned into jelly! Certainly, Frodo gladly put away his paranoia in a chest, Pippin and Merry hadn't been off the Mallorns for the whole time, Sam crawled around Lorien greenhouses. You know how civilians are. But Boromir?! Aragorn?! Could it be that in a month these warriors had not developed even a slight concern? Yes. Because the delay of the squad was organized professionally! I see two options: to calm well (sedatives) or to cheer well. The former hypothesis is supported by the general feeling of the Fellowship that the month had passed unnoticed, as in a dream. They did not even understand how much time had passed. Well, the method is reliable enough and is not a problem for elves. But, gentlemen, it's so vulgar! Plus, it is dangerous. What if the magi-hypno-chemical experiments come to light? The consequences of such exposure cannot be imagined. Lorien's reputation would turn into dust, and that's at least. No, I think the things are more ingenious and simple. For, oh, Donna Rosa, what can quench the thirst of a traveler but a glass of whiskey?.. /A quote from the Soviet movie "Hello, I'm Your Aunt!" — *translator.*/ In Lorien, the squad was provided with absolutely **all** the pleasures of a peaceful life! And no moral traumas. It is just that, gentlemen, I am sure that the immortality of elves could not but affect the relationship of the sexes. And from my philistine point of view, the impact was not beneficial. Do not consider me a cynic, but, perhaps, even the marriage of the Firstborn did not imply the sexual monopoly of the spouses. Eternity and subtle artistic nature all rolled into one — an endless dream and the same endless aspiration for everything new, unknown... *"Ah, darling, this Boromir is a real animal! When he saw me in that shirt... Hee-hee-hee! And the dwarf? Do you know, has anyone managed... Oh, my lips are sealed..."* An international squad, straight out of Moria, made the same impression on Galadriel's bored maids of honor, as a luna park in the village of Olkhovka. A month?! I bow before the asceticism of stern warriors! I would not have come out of there at all!.. I would crawl out... And to justify the delay, I would also ramble about "magical air", "frozen time" etc, but not a word about the true reason: that I was just stuck under a skirt...

But Lorien's exploits of Boromir pale in comparison with the work done in that month by the elven intelligence. Apparently, the new operation was designed literally within a week. And by the time of the departure of the squad, it was already in full swing! And it was as treacherous as it was elegant. By the way, it is very likely that Haldir, who met the Fellows at the edge of the Golden Wood, is one of its heads, and, in general, occupies a serious post in the military elite of Lorien.

So why was the Fellowship detained? The answer is given by the waterfalls of Rauros. Isn't it surprising that three independent groups of orcs simultaneously made an ambush in the same place! Moreover, they met there long before the arrival of the "game", because they had time not only to come to agreement but also to disguise themselves so well that neither Legolas nor Aragorn detected their presence at all! And there were *over two hundred* orcs there!..

That's where the month went, just that! For contacting Sauron and Saruman, and for all the interested parties to approach Rauros. *"I have returned from the Northern Fences,"* says Haldir before the Company sails out. Wasn't it rather the south, Hal? Wasn't it you who brought the news: "everything is ready, send them over." The lords of Lorien decided to sacrifice the piece that Gandalf so carefully nurtured. It's a thing of beauty: three orc packs met, killed Frodo and quarreled over the Ring! As a result, Saruman thinks that It is in Mordor and shakes with fear, Sauron thinks It is in Isengard and grinds his teeth, and, just in case, both of them suspect Ugluk and Grishnakh etc. And the Ring quietly slumbers in Lorien forever and ever. Amen. Since, shiver me timbers, there was the fourth squad at Rauros! *A squad of Lorien archers.* Those were not even noticed by the orcs. Elves were to, if necessary, provoke a fight, and then wait a little and clean up whatever still moves. As a result, a hundred corpses on the shore, a hundred in Anduin, and the Ring disappeared **again!** It is anywhere, but not in Lorien.

It's funny that Sauron only sent forty orcs to intercept the Ring, half as much as Saruman. According to Grishnakh, however, there is still a "winged Nazgul" waiting on the bank. I like it! In the Shire, as many as nine of them came to scare the farmers. And where it smells of fighting, none of them hurries to come. And a Nazgul in the ambush is essential! So that the Ring-bearer does not escape... Sauron just **does not want** to take the Ring!!! This bunch of orcs has already been written off as combat losses. Sauron just feigns his interest...

Most of all the Lorien improvisation amazes me with its flexibility, parallelism if you wish. If it works out — great! If it does not — everything will go on normally, according to Gandalf's plan. But it could not possibly fail... Everything was calculated and counted. I'm sure even the **intervention of a Nazgul** was envisaged! Only an absurdity derailed the operation "Isildur-2". The outburst of Boromir! Frodo **had time** to put on the Ring because he did it **before** the attack of the orcs... And, surely, in their view. And immediately the ambush lost its meaning! SS (Saruman-Sauron) squads started acting discordantly. Someone rushed for Frodo and ran into Boromir, someone ran to catch the other hobbits etc. *"Idiots,"* whispered Haldir, *"let's head home, boys."*

* * *

The further story of the Ring is, in general, banal, but we should focus on some points. They are not particularly interesting, in my opinion, but they add some colorful and realistic details in the general theme.

The main one is the conversation between Frodo and Faramir in the chapter "The Window on the West".

When comparing the two sons of Denethor, undoubtedly, it is the younger one that fully fits the definition of "the son of the Ruling Steward". Intellect, responsibility, education, military training, patience etc — these qualities are as inherent to him as his facial features. Just a few phrases — and his psychological portrait gently and unobtrusively enters your consciousness (just like, by the way, the portrait of Boromir does with all his pride, arrogance etc). If you try to assign military specialties of the brothers, then the older one is a hundred percent warrior, while the younger one leans towards secret services. And suddenly something at first glance incomprehensible begins. It turns out that this "educated" person not only does not know the essence of Isildur's Bane but does not even know where Imladris is! /I could not find the corresponding quote (not even in the Russian translation) — *translator.*/ What is it, sons of Denethor are not taught geography? But with tremendous perseverance, Faramir keeps asking Frodo about this bane. Suggests options, among which are (in chronological order) Isildur's death itself, "heirloom" and "weapon" (while constantly monitoring Frodo's reaction). Please note, the "heirloom" is not the first and not the last version. This may be an accident, but I believe that Faramir knew much more than he wanted to show. All this conversation in the cave is a most typical interrogation, however, in a very mild form. And the aim of any interrogation is to squeeze out as much information as possible but to give out the minimum. And Faramir, a professional, "cracks" an amateur Frodo like a pine log, having remained in his eyes a person who does not know geography...

The second point is the destruction of the Ring. In principle, everything is clear and simple here. But, purely out of jackass motives, I want to question one postulate. The death of Sauron. In my opinion, it requires not an exclamation, but a big question mark. That smoke cloud with human contours, rising above Barad-dur, does not convince me at all. Gandalf had arranged more sophisticated fireworks back in the Shire...

In conclusion of these mental exercises, of which I'm bored myself, I want to focus briefly on real mysteries. Fusing the narrative in small things, I still have not managed to dovetail the global ones. And the most glaring discrepancy is that the victory in the Great War was staked on a ridiculously weak card — the Fellowship. This is not even an escapade — it's recklessness! This can only be explained by a hoax. The destruction of the Ring was not at all what was persistently hammered into us for a thousand pages. The same eagles that rescued Frodo and Sam from the slope of Orodruin just as easily could have brought them *there.* Without any dangers, deaths, callused feet, and incurable neuroses. Perhaps, the clue is hidden in the campaign of the Fellowship itself, or rather, in its consequences...

What happened in Middle-earth as a result of the destruction of the Ring? That's what...

Sauron has been eliminated, magic has disappeared, a kind of military bloc has been formed consisting of peoples who delegated expedition members to Orodruin; and, finally, elves have left. These are the bare, well-known facts. They are related but connected insofar as.., well, that's how it happened... And lately, it seems to me that the haze hiding the truth is mainly in the priorities. Events are deliberately presented to us in the wrong sequence, and, accordingly, we incorrectly determine the importance of these events...

And the fact is that at the end of the Third Age, elves were approaching the most severe crisis in their history. Their time had simply ended. Sauron had been waiting for this for a long time and was ready... Imagine that Mordor and Gondor made peace and carved up spheres of influence. The global evacuation of the elven people begins. And suddenly a lot of "legitimate" heirs claiming their lands and achievements come out of the woodwork. Vultures fly in from everywhere. The Firstborns who are falling behind are slaughtered like Huguenots on the St. Bartholomew's Day. And they, in turn, snarl back, trying to cause maximum damage before their death. To make them remember!..

Were elves capable of provoking an ecological catastrophe? Quite, quite possible (the answer lies in Lorien). Apparently, Sauron took this possibility into account and did not want to become the Master of the Great Desert. He is at war with the Firstborn only at the political-diplomatic level, having entrusted the military conflict with Gondor to Tar-Minastir (the Witch-king). The situation is ridiculous to the extreme: a serious war only serves as a distraction. *Do not worry guys, you have nothing to worry about yet, but nevertheless hurry up — the war will not last forever...*

The Lords analyzed this situation. They take the war under their control. They bet on Gondor. It must win, but not brilliantly, in a last-ditch effort. To make it lick its wounds for half a century. And, most importantly, win with the help of elves and quite spectacularly at that! The Fellowship, the Ring, and Orodruin are "Enola Gay", "Little Boy" and Hiroshima! At the same time, the Firstborn do not advertise their support for Gondor, because anything can happen in sports — your favorite team may easily lose. Then, instead of exsanguinated Minas Tirith, they will deal with the equally exsanguinated Barad-dur, that's all...

God only knows how many elven birds Frodo killed by throwing the Ring into the fire. Destroying magic is not the least of them. Before leaving, elves eliminate their heritage. People should not reveal their secrets! Especially magic...

So the emigration of elves was not a **consequence**, but the **cause** of the Fellows' campaign. For a deeper analysis, I'm sorry, I do not have enough brains...


### On elves

*Withering. It fills the heart with aching sorrow. The withering of the Great People is doubly sad.*

*The Star of Noldor has set. Only legends remind of the former power. Only Wisdom remains, but it is not enough to cast away the Shadow creeping from the east. However, this is not Their problem anymore. The wounds inflicted on the Elvish people in the Battle of Dagorlad and the siege of Barad-dur are too heavy. They can never recover from them. Now elves just want to leave...*

*On the site of the once fearsome kingdoms — only scattered, year by year melting settlements. Like crumbling fragments of an ancient fresco. Rivendell... Lorien... Grey Havens... And above all this — Sadness...*

*But do not hurry to mourn, old fellow! Look closely at these fragments, and they will suddenly unite into a single picture, majestic and terrible. For the Shadow has already covered Middle-earth, and this is the Shadow of the **Golden Wood!***

*It was at Sunset that their main strength awakened in the Eldar. It was dozing for thousands of years, during the Age of Blossoming. When great armies and great spells made Morgoth himself flee. But the armies fell, the spells weakened, and finally, Wisdom has woken up...*

* * *

In the middle of the Third Age, an elven feat of strength was performed, not only not glorified in songs but not even mentioned in the Book. And yet, I think this feat is the greatest in the history of the Noldor. It was even beyond the powers of King Fingolfin. The name of the elf who performed it is Lady Galadriel. Some will doubt the motives, some will not like the methods, but the fact remains: in the shadow of the Golden Wood, the unification of elves of Middle-earth took place!

A participant of the Feanor's campaign, Galadriel did not come to Middle-earth for the Silmarils. What attracted her was *"to see the wide unguarded lands and to rule there a realm at her own will"* (Silmarillion, Ch. 9). During the two eras, while swords were speaking, she patiently waited. And only at Dusk, when the union became not only possible but also inevitable, she headed the elven people. The formerly independent Havens, Rivendell and Lorien were welded together in a kind of federation, a triad, and each link in this chain surprisingly turned out to be in the right place and began to fulfill its special function. From this moment on the foreign policy of the Firstborn changes radically. It is as if a quiet sad voice sounds that cannot be disobeyed: *"Enough of deaths! The blood of elves is too valuable to shed it on the battlefields. Let the savages tear at each other's throats..."* And in the Third Age, the battle at Fornost was the only major fight with the participation of elven armies. The one where the superiority of Earnur over the Witch-king was overwhelming, where to not take the side of Gondor was politically short-sighted and even dangerous.

To Galadriel, a woman who turned the world over with the movement of her little finger, with whom I absolutely **do not** sympathize and whom I infinitely admire, this chapter is devoted...


### Rivendell


#### On sources

For a long time, I have subconsciously shied away from the conversation on the subject of Rivendell. It is extraordinarily complex. The burden that Rivendell took upon itself, the multidimensionality of the problems it solves in the elven triad.., I just did not know where to start. It is here that the keys to many elven secrets are kept. And these keys are in plain sight. As if not a mythical, but a **historic** character laid them out among bright, distracting trinkets in the hope of the reader's thoughtfulness and observation. Probably my cheap joke about the "inattentive elven censor" had already stuck in everybody's teeth. The joke is not quite truthful. The negligence of the censor was conscious. It is this mysterious elf who is the true author of the disguised message. For the skill with which it is composed is not human... And the most beautiful thing, gentlemen, that this elf **has signed!**

The main share of the scandalous conclusions was obtained from a monotonous comparison of dates in the Tale of Years (LotR, Appendix B). According to Tolkien, this work was made by Meriadoc who *"obtained assistance and information from Rivendell, which he visited more than once. There, though Elrond has departed, his sons long remained, together with some of the High-elven folk. It is said that Celeborn went to dwell there after the departure of Galadriel; but there is no record of the day when at last he sought the Grey Havens..."* (LotR, Prologue) And there also: *"Though the dates given are often conjectural, especially for the Second Age, they deserve attention."* (ibid.) And forgive my immodesty, gentlemen, but having stumbled upon the last phrase, I realized that it was addressed to me personally...

Why did Celeborn not leave for the West with his wife? Why do I suspect him of that unauthorized mentorship of Tolkien? First of all, of course, because of this completely inexplicable reference in Prologue. Too sporadic and pale his role in the main narrative, too vague the reason for the delay... But it is not just that. Have you been asking yourself a question, gentlemen: who is he, after all?!!

*"Galadriel his sister went not with him /Finrod/ to Nargothrond, for in Dorian dwelt Celeborn, kinsman of Thingol, and there was great love between them. Therefore she remained in the Hidden Kingdom, and abode with Melian, and of her learned great lore and wisdom concerning Middle-earth."* ("Silmarillion", Ch. 13) Let's leave the talk about love to the authors of women's novels. This marriage, at least from the bride's side, was a well-thought-out political move. Even in Valinor, Galadriel was smart enough not to join the Oath of Feanor. She was the only one of the organizers of the Exile who was not affected by the Doom of Mandos! Here, too, she did not blunder.

After a while, Thingol learns about the massacre of the Teleri, which Feanor made in Swanhaven. He is so shocked that he forbids speaking the language of the Noldor in his domain! From now on, they are fratricides to him! A wide chasm would separate the Noldor and the Sindar for a long time, bringing joy to the Enemy. But Galadriel managed to jump to the right side of the chasm... And how!

Without a doubt, a kinsman of the most powerful king of Middle-earth is a very successful party, but hadn't she sold her life short? And by the way, what kind of kinsman? Could you be more specific? Sure thing...

When the world was still young, the Valar, fearing for the fate of elves, decided to relocate them to Valinor. But elves did not want to heed the call. And Orome elected three ambassadors among the Quendi, *"who should go to Valinor and speak for their people; and these were Ingwe, Finwe, and Elwe, who afterwards were kings... Then Orome brought them back."* (Silmarillion, Ch. 3) Elwe could not return to the Blessed Realm. He met Maia Melian. *"... And straightaway a spell was laid on him, so they stood thus while long years were measured by the wheeling stars above them; and the trees of Nan Elmoth grew tall and dark... In after days he became a king renowned, and his people were all the Eldar of Beleriand... Elu Thingol in the tongue of that land... And Melian was his Queen..."* (Silmarillion, Ch. 4)

And the Teleri people, having been left without a leader, after long search chose Olwe, a brother of Elwe, and he took them to Valinor... Of course, many remained, Cirdan, for example. But we are interested in "kinsmen". And here it is! *"The kinsfolk and friends of Elwe Singollo also remained in the Hither Lands, seeking him yet, though they would fain have departed to Valinor..."* (Silmarillion, Ch. 5) Everything is logical. They were held by the duty of friendship and the duty of kinship. Apparently the moral principles of elves, even at the dawn of existence, were quite high... But explain to me why did not only friends remain in Middle Earth?! After all, Olwe, his own brother, had gone over the sea?! For any "kinsman" it is a carte blanche for emigration and a clear conscience! (*"His own brother abandoned him, why should I stay?!"*) I see only one explanation: the remaining ones were more "kin" than the brother. The term "kinsmen" Tolkien delicately substitutes for the word "bastard", an illegitimate son! Galadriel married the **son** of Elu Thingol!!! And it was thanks to this marriage that she became the Lady of the Golden Wood. For the elves of Lorien, a daughter of the king of the *Noldor* meant nothing, but a son of High King of the *Sindar* had every right to be called their king.

And the happy newlyweds for the whole two (!) Ages disappear from the field of view of the chroniclers. The kingdoms are crumbling, the great kings perish. Betrayal and valor, overtaking each other, input often unknown names in history. But you will not find the name "Celeborn" at all. *"Do not rush, dear, your time has not come yet..."*

Why did Celeborn stay in Middle-earth after the War of the Rings? Everything is over. The chain of elven settlements begins a systematic evacuation. Like a giant red carpet rolls down to the West. First leaves the Golden Wood and, apparently, Mirkwood. The administration of the Triad moves to Rivendell. Of course, the Supreme Lord of the Eldar of that period was Celeborn. He was responsible for elves leaving in an orderly way, with dignity and, most importantly, taking with them all their secrets...

And at this moment master Brandybuck appears in Rivendell — a historian from the Shire, a participant of the legendary campaign of the Fellowship. He understands that with the departure of the Firstborn, the most valuable information about the Ancient Ages will disappear irrevocably. And he hurries, he writes down everything, not really thinking about the meaning. And Celeborn does not stop him — he makes him his unwitting accomplice, a postman...

And the information stored in Rivendell, gentlemen, is truly explosive! To hide it, it's best to simply say "we do not know," even concerning innocuous facts. Or to not let Merry into Rivendell... But Aragorn is too powerful a patron, and he is personally interested in these studies! Celeborn allows Merry into the archives. And by becoming his censor, remains clean in the eyes of fellow elves!

It is (and was) no secret for anyone that elves have gathered more information about Middle-earth than anybody else. And this is not a result of idle curiosity. In the political game they were leading, any most insignificant fact, buried under the layers of centuries, could become the strongest trump card. Archives of Havens and Rivendell, I am sure, contained historical chronicles of Numenor, Arnor, Gondor more detailed than the domestic chronicles of these countries. The history of Rohan, for example, was more scarce. It's easier to gather information about allies than about neutrals, especially the "wary ones." And here we come across the most elegant passage of our "whistle-blowers"!.. *Kings of Rohan, you say? Here you go! Since the time of Eorl the Young: the birth, the death, brief information. Princes of Arnor? Here you are! Dates of death, brief reference... Date of birth?.. I'm afraid these data is lost, my friend. Numenor? Well, it was so long ago! But there is something... Here, just for you... You're welcome...*

Of course, if one of the patriotic elves took a more careful look at Merry's notes, he would break a sweat and stop this disgrace! But at that time they were all **packing their bags!** *What are you saying? We gave them Rohan? Well, let them read! And did they ask about Arnor?.. Only deaths?! Numenor, you say, only bits and pieces?!! Ha-ha-ha! Capital! I'm even sorry, Lord, that they are not able to appreciate your humor...*

Now then, gentlemen, we did appreciate the Lord's humor! And we join your applause with pleasure... From these "scarce" facts, we learned how you held Gordor by the throat for a thousand (!) of years, in what funny way new leaders appeared among the Dunedain, and even who in fact had a full and indisputable right to the thrones of both Gondor and Arnor! Such petty things as the name of the Witch-king, it is awkward to even mention... Bravo, Celeborn!

But why did the Lord brew all this mess?.. I cannot find an unequivocal answer. Maybe it's just a banal grievance against a high-born wife who abandoned her provincial spouse. Or maybe a belated riot of an eternal henpecked husband... Anything is possible. But it seems to me that this is an attempt to ask for forgiveness from the depths of the ages: *"Farewell! No hard feelings. We brought much grief to this land, and yet we loved it..."*


#### Elrond

The fate of this warrior is beautiful and tragic. Men considered him a lucky one, elves an upstart. He chose the fate of the Firstborn, but did he regret his choice? Elros Tar-Minyatur, his mortal brother, became the first king of Numenor. Isn't it better than being an eternal squire of Gil-galad? For one and a half thousand years, Elrond Half-elven wore the label of a foster child at the court of Lindon. The goodwill of the Lord without the support of influential relatives causes only jealousy and condescending grins behind one's back... Maeglin the elf broke down and opened the gates of Gondolin to Melkor. Elrond the half-blood persevered and founded Rivendell...

And here's how it happened. In the year 1695 of the Second Age, Sauron's invasion of Eriador began. Gil-galad sends Elrond with a detachment of Noldor to help Celebrimbor. What was it? An elevation of the stepson? Experienced commanders are generally sent in such expeditions. But then why a "detachment", and not an "army"? /Again, seems like an inaccurate Russian translation. In LotR, Appendix B the original reads "1697... Elrond retreats with remnant of the Noldor", while the Russian translation has, literally "1697... Elrond with a detachment of the Noldor has to retreat". That is, it can be understood as retreating with the same detachment he arrived with. Nevertheless, it is safe to assume that Elrond was sent to Eregion either with a small detachment or even completely alone, since the original just says "1695... Gil-galad sends Elrond to Eregion", and no accompanying forces are mentioned — *translator.*/ Or is it help of the type "sorry, neighbor, that's all I've got...", and then they are a suicide squad, expendables. And the first candidate for the role of the commander is the traditional target of bullying, the one for whom there is no one to intercede...

The help was not enough. The blooming Eregion had turned into a desert. Celebrimbor died. But Elrond made a miracle! He gained a foothold in Imladris and founded the fortress Rivendell. They had lasted for three years until the campaign of Numenoreans who threw Sauron out of Eregion — now that's military aid!

The years of peace had come. Elrond stayed in Rivendell as a viceroy of Gil-galad. The court was happy with this, for when a Target of Mockery turns into a Winner, it is better to shove him into a province so that he does not turn his nose up. But, most importantly, it suited Elrond himself. Perhaps here, in Imladris, he first began to breathe deeply...

And for seventeen centuries (!) Rivendell had stayed away from great wars. But Mordor is eternal! In the year 3429 of the Second Age, the invasion of Gondor begins. Elves and men form an alliance and come out against Sauron. Was it the Ruling Ring, by any chance, that caused this alliance? After all, it's better to defeat Sauron together than to allow the ally do it alone!.. It makes no sense now to try and guess what plans Gil-galad and Elendil made with respect to the Ring — destroy it or appropriate it. And we should not desecrate the memory of heroes with vile suspicions. Let us return to Elrond. He was the herald of Gil-galad and marched in front of the army... Perhaps it is a great honor and recognition of merit (after all, the Lord passes on the Ring of Vilya to no other than him). Or maybe it is the result of centuries-long intrigues because the vanguard of the advancing army is a very risky place. One thing, strangely enough, does not exclude the other...

Elrond survived the giant massacre at Dagorlad and the Plateau of Gorgoroth. Until now, he is only a modest head of a border garrison. He is three and a half thousand years old!..

*The surviving warriors wander through the bloody field, helping the wounded. Gil-galad is being carried... Elendil... Isildur glances at his father and a once again immerses himself into contemplation of the object lying on the palm of his hand... Cirdan frowns, again and again glancing over the elves, the Numenoreans... over the elves again... As if hesitating... There are fewer elves around... He stands up, approaches Isildur... Says something... They look at the Mountain together. The Gondorian laughs... Cirdan limps to Elrond. He is silent.., then he grins, but his voice is colorless...*

*"Fortify Imladris, El..," and adds thoughtfully, "you'll need carpenters... lots of them..."*

* * *

Two years later, orcs kill Isildur at Gladden Fields, north of Lorien. Thanks to this lucky accident, Cirdan for a time had no need for carpenters. But Elrond did fortify Rivendell. And not with walls, but with good neighbors. The foreign policy of Rivendell was such that in a hundred years the motley population of Eregion and Eriador was a hundred percent sympathetic to elves. Of course, this had not been without some "material aid", but you know, you cannot buy love with money. Rivendell was by no means an "investor" of Middle-earth, but its Spiritual Center. For the first time in history, an elven polis did not pull its head and paws into a thick shell, but threw it off altogether! And the result manifested almost immediately. A wide "loyal" ring had formed around Rivendell, the population of which was not formally a military ally, but in the event of an attack it rallied and stood under the banner of Elrond.

The most interesting thing is that, having become the recognized leader of Middle-earth, Elrond did not become a Lord. He was still considered (and, apparently, considered himself) a vassal of the late Gil-galad. For three thousand years, he had never managed to acquire the most valuable quality for a politician — Ambition, and to get rid of the flaw — Nobility. He was like a wounded pawn, who had reached the last row and stopped overtaken by moral doubts: *"but do I have the right to become a queen?.."* Only an experienced grandmaster could understand that in this position the pawn had already turned into a queen... Moreover, this transformation had taken place a hundred years ago under the walls of Barad-dur! And there was such a grandmaster in Middle-earth. His name appears briefly only a few times during the events of the First Age, and in minor, "peaceful" episodes at that. In the Second one, it seems like he doesn't exist, but he is alive and, as it turns out, closely follows the progress of the game... He makes a single "silent" move and again retreats into the shadow...

In the year 109 of the Third Age, Elrond takes Celebrian, the daughter of Celeborn and Galadriel, as his wife. The next morning everyone calls him "Lord"! But the main thing for him was not the title. He was recognized as an insider, **of full value!** For the first time in thirty-five centuries!!! Thus he put on himself the invisible *bridle of Debt.* Henceforth, the Golden Wood did not have to be afraid to hear the word "no" from Elrond.

The tragedy that turned the bridle into shackles occurred in 2509. The moral, self-made debt becomes slavery. On the way to Lorien, at the Caradhras Pass, Celebrian falls into an orc ambush. A wound from a poisoned arrow, captivity, torture... Her sons save her. The physical wounds heal. But not the spiritual ones... She sails over the Sea.

Nobility has one stupid habit — to take all the blame on itself. Elrond, Elrond, how did you endure five hundred years with such a stone in your heart! A burden of being second-rate, a burden of responsibility, a burden of guilt — this person never went light. *"...then Elrond grew weary at last and forsook Middle-earth, never to return,"* (Lotr, Appendix A, "The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen") — Tolkien is elegantly laconic... I dare to add, he left, having paid off all the elven debts... But more on that later...

Of course, if I wanted, I could do without these lamentations about the mournful fate. But, gentlemen, the fact is that it was exactly the uniqueness of Elrond's personality, his highest authority both among elves and men, that became the reason for the phenomenon of Rivendell.


#### Rivendell

The first thing that catches the eye during a political assessment of Rivendell in the Elven Triad is its unmistakable military orientation. It actually leads an armed struggle against Sauron. And it's not so important that it's just sabotage and reconnaissance raids of the Dunadain and elven rangers. This is war! It is not difficult to guess that the main forces of the Triad are based here. Strategically, everything is perfect. These forces occupy a defensive position and therefore are removed far from the "front edge", so as not to fall victim to a sudden strike. In fact, it's Lorien's shield.

Another function of Rivendell is the cultural and educational center of Middle-earth. The City of Sages, a kind of Shambhala. But this is just a "hobby". For respect and authority, so to speak...

And behind these scarce trees a real forest hides. In general, when reading any myth, we imperceptibly fall into an amusing and quite harmless psychological trap. Both Zeus and Hercules are for us beings of the same "level of reality" — the zeroth one. In the case of, say, Aule and Aragorn, the same thing happens, but it is not so harmless. To clarify, a short quote: *"...and after the days of Tar-Ancalimon the offering of the fruits to Eru was neglected, and men went seldom any more to the Hallow..."* (Silmarillion, "The Downfall of Numenor") This is nothing but a **religion,** gentlemen! And both in "Silmarillion" and in "LotR", there are at most three or so such phrases, pointing to some kind of cult!!! The Valar in the "chronicles" of the ancient Ages are **real,** they live and commit deeds in front of the eyes of their contemporaries!.. Does this remind you of anything? Of course! "Silmarillion" is not Ancient History — it is the **Old Testament** of Middle-earth! Remember for what advice Boromir came to Rivendell. To interpret a dream. Let it be the official and not the true reason, but this "legend" did not surprise anyone! And with such a question, gentlemen, people come not to a philosopher, but to a **priest.** Elrond is not "just" a Lord — he is the High Priest of the Cult of Eru. Rivendell was the **religious** center of Middle-earth. And this was its most important role for elves! For if you worshiped Eru — you accepted the Eru's scheme of the Universe, therefore, you automatically recognized elves as the **superior race!** Or caste, if you want. Elves are brahmins, men are kshatriyas, dwarves are vaishyas, and of course, there are shudras! Cannot do without them! So that dwarves do not feel inferior, there are orcs — dirt, filth and so on...

Thus the peoples of Middle-earth were divided in the eyes of the Firstborn not to "light ones" and "dark ones", but rather to "faithful ones" and "infidels"... To the west of the Misty Mountains, mainly the former ones lived, to the east — mostly the latter ones.


### The kin of Arvedui

*"When the kingdom /Arnor/ ended the Dunedain passed into the shadows and became a secret and wandering people..."* (LotR, Appendix A, "Eriador, Arnor and the heirs of Isildur")

Apparently, there were good reasons why Arnor could not be reborn from the ashes. Most likely, the hostile tribes of Dunlending shepherds were in the way. However, elves were not interested in this either. And yet they were providing shelter and food to the heirs of Arvedui for thousand-odd years!..

If you wipe the tears of tender emotion from your eyes and look at this situation intently, you can find more mundane motives for the responsiveness and kindness of the Lords...

The first thing lying on the surface is the military aspect. At Elrond's disposal appears a solid, well-trained fighting squad of the northerners, that is capable, without throwing the slightest shadow on Rivendell, of conducting sabotage and reconnaissance actions throughout Middle-earth. The devotion of the Dunadain to Imladris is beyond doubt. They simply do not have any choice. Under the wing of Elrond, they at least retain the hope of restoring the dynasty. In any other court, they cannot rise above the mercenary status.

But elves would not have been elves if they had used only the military potential of the fallen dynasty. The patronage of the Dunadain gave the Firstborn, first of all, the most powerful political trump cards.

In 2050, Earnur, the last king of Gondor, disappears near Minas Morgul. Mardil becomes the first Ruling Steward. The Age of Stewards lasts for almost a thousand years, until 3019. Don't you find it strange that for a **thousand** years the throne of a great empire is empty, and its legitimate masters roam the swamps and sleep under the trees, wrapped in camouflage cloaks? The Dunadain do not make even weak attempts to start reigning in Minas Tirith. The reason for this modesty can only be one — elves did not support the claims of the northerners to the crown of Gondor. *"Your time has not yet come,"* Elrond repeated these words every seventy years to each new leader. And each Steward of Gondor knew that somewhere there lives the True King. One day he will come and demand that which belongs to him by right. **But...** if one *consults* the Wise Elves from time to time on foreign policy issues, this day will not come too soon... No, no, I'm not saying that the Stewards openly danced to the Lorien' tune. They were free and proud. To their endless freedom there was only one small restriction — no negotiations with Sauron.

The shadow dynasty of the Dunadain was a convenient lever to put pressure on Gondor. But elves took care of the heirs of Arnor for one more reason: they had the weapon inaccessible to the Firstborn — the Stone of Erech. The Prince of Blood of Gondor, and only he, had power over the shadows of the Oathbreakers. The impostor can still slip to the throne of Minas Tirith, but he will never pass Paths of the Dead. And there is a discrepancy here! These princes did not live in bunkers with security guards and alarms. On the contrary, they risked their lives almost every day! Moreover, they even had an heir at seventy or eighty. And still, neither an orcish arrow nor a troll's club had not managed to interrupt the dynasty of Arvedui in a thousand years. What is it?! A miracle from the category of "fortune favors the foolish"? No way! Behind the apparent carelessness lies an amazingly beautiful design of security measures. And "Annals..." (well, of course!..) and Aragorn's biography allow one to look behind the veil of secrecy.

Aragorn was only three years old when his father was killed by trolls. At Elrond's insistence, the leader's heir had not been informed of his origin until he turned twenty, and he had been living in Rivendell under the name Estel, for *"...the Wise then knew that the Enemy was seeking to discover the Heir of Isildur..."* (LotR, Appendix A, "The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen") He was not brought up under glass, since already by the age of twenty he had done "great deeds" in the company of Elladan and Elrohir... Well, and so on, I am not going to repeat what everyone already knows. There seems to be nothing unusual, to a unique person — a unique destiny. But one thought has been bothering me for a long time. Why, after all, did the leaders of the Rangers have the heirs so late in life? Aragorn married Arwen at the age of 88 and left the world at 210 (in the family of Striders this is the absolute record of longevity). But judging by the "Annals..." all his ancestors were terminal bachelors... For too long each of them had been resisting marriage. It seems like they had been real men, who had valued freedom above the safety of the dynasty, hadn't they?

But if you make a single assumption — all this confusion merges suddenly into a harmonious and unusually reasonable picture. Aragorn's youth was **typical** for the Dunedain. First, they were all brought up in Rivendell, and secondly, until they reached adulthood (or possibly even after that) they knew only the legend of their origin. In Rivendell there was a kind of military boarding school for northerner boys. Did Aragorn have brothers? Certainly! Extreme education conditions could break the life of an heir at any moment, so the more "spare options", the better. And no jealousy, no intrigues! At a certain point in time, Elrond simply proclaimed the new leader. Not necessarily the oldest one. The age, training, experience, psychological profile etc were taken into account. And, I beg you, no royal ambitions! Of course, such an open house as Imladris must have been visited by Mordor spies, at least under the guise of pilgrims. A single Adan boy they would have found instantly. It doesn't take a brainiac to understand: the boy is not as simple as he looks! But in a crowd of similar-looking teenagers, who did not know a single thing about themselves, not to mention a comrade, good luck trying to find the Isildur's heir! This institution was supervised, apparently, by Elrond's sons. The mysterious "company of Elladan and Elrohir" consisted entirely of foster children! Future leaders learned the science of killing and surviving since birth. And obeying the elf mentor. Perhaps, only Aragorn was brought up not as a leader, but as the future King of Gondor. Why did the pedagogical technique of Rivendell suddenly make such a turn? Because the time had come! When Estel was eleven years old, a small hobbit from the Shire found Sauron's Ring... For Gondor fighting with Mordor, it's enough to be moderately loyal, but for a *thousand* years. Gondor the victor should not just be loyal — it should be, even just for a *hundred* years, but absolutely devoted! Until the Firstborn leave, and then — the flood... /A reference to the phrase "Après nous le déluge" ("After us, the flood") attributed to Louis XV — *translator.*/

So, approximately in this manner, I came to a wild conclusion: Aragorn should have at least one illegitimate son (and given his age, a grandson too, but it does not matter much). The dynasty of Isildur should not be interrupted, forgive me, Arwen. If we take all my reasoning at face value and assume that "LotR" is not a fantasy but a reality, then there should be at least a glimpse of this "mathematically proven" bastard at the pages of the book. But where can you possibly find him! It would be easier with the proverbial cat in a dark room... I, of course, looked at the most probable place just to clear my conscience... And, then, gentlemen, it was the first time I felt eerie. Because I found him!..

*"The pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand... a horseman could be seen dismounting and walking slowly forward...*

*'Halbarad Dunadan, Ranger of the North I am,' cried the man. 'We seek one Aragorn son of Arathorn...'*

*'Halbarad!' he said. 'Of all joys this is the least expected!'*

*'...but the brethren Elladan and Elrohir have ridden with us, desiring to go to war. We rode as swiftly as we might when your summons came.'*

*'But I did not summon you,' said Aragorn."* (LotR, Book V, Ch. 2)

It's not a summons, Aragorn, old friend. A tiny detachment of the Dunedain and, most importantly, two elven princes are nothing more than an *authorized coronation embassy.* Elves will present the Sword and the Crown and witness your right when you save Gondor. If you, God forbid, perish, sleep well... And long live Halbarad, King of Gondor! They will disclose his origin before the coronation. And remember, Strider, if Minas Tirith falls, the kin of Arvedui will no longer be of any interest to **anyone...**

Of course, one can argue with this version, write off everything to an ordinary coincidence etc. I understand this perfectly well and do not impose my opinion on anyone. So Aragorn was delighted to see his old friend, so what?! But in the same chapter, a little further, there is a beautiful detail... *"'In a high chamber of the Burg,' said Legolas... '...and only his kinsman, Halbarad, went with him; but some dark doubt or care sits on him.'"* The word *"kinsman"* the elf says **not to us,** but to **them...** Imagine that you witnessed this joyful meeting. You see two men. One is already over the hill, the other is younger. They, obviously, have known each other for a long time and look surprisingly alike. There is general awkwardness and sad eyes of the Maiden of Lorien behind the scenes... "Calm down, it's just a *kinsman!*" — A general sigh of relief... - "Well, if it's a *kinsman,* it's a whole different thing! And we were starting to think..."

And the devil pulled me into the Book translated by Muravyova! There no-one calls Halbarad a "kinsman" of Aragorn. They call that the **whole** detachment of the Dunedain. And this can simply be a common beautiful metaphor. "Not a Strider, but some kind of a ladies' man," I thought, gritting my teeth. I had to tear my bottom off a cozy stool and look for the English text. For the first time in the whole duration of the research... So, Halbarad is a "kinsman" of Aragorn, a relative, in our words. Vivat, Grigorieva and Grushetsky — The Greatest Translators of all Worlds!

Of course, this is of no use, but I want to add, to close off the topic, that Halbarad Half-elven, "the spare King of Gondor", walked the Paths of the Dead, went up Anduin on Umbar ships and died in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. How — nobody knows. Probably, from an orcish arrow to the chest...


#### Aragorn and Arwen

/I couldn't find the source of the epigraph from the original text — *translator.*/

A long time ago, back in the First Age, two amazing events happened in the history of Middle-earth. Princesses of Doriath and Gondolin, rejecting the most worthy Eldar suitors, gave their love to mortals. And immediately, as if fulfilling their destiny, both kingdoms crumbled to dust...

Beren and Luthien, Tuor and Idril Celebrindal — from these mixed marriages the two dynasties of the Half-elven began. At the end of the First Age, they merged, personified by Earendil the Blessed and Elving, daughter of Dior... and again diverged with their sons Elrond and Elros for six and a half thousand years... But one night, at the decline of the Third Age, young Estel heard the singing of an elf maiden in a forest...

They say that the beauty of the Fairest of all the Children of the World returned to Middle-earth with the birth of Arwen. Both beauty and fate... Why am I so sad? The legend of Beren and Luthien brings happiness. Their love was stronger than Morgoth, and Carcharoth, and death itself. Even the Doom of Mandos, imposed on the Feanor's jewels, faded while the Fairest was wearing them...

*"...Arwen Undomiel shall not diminish her life's grace lot less cause. She shall not be the bride of any Man less than the King of both Gondor and Arnor."* (LotR, Appendix A, "Tale of Aragorn and Arwen") This is the crux of the matter, because Luthien did not follow a king, but a simple wanderer, and pulled him out of the clutches of Sauron. And let these maidens be equal in their beauty, the fate of one is bright and joyful, while the other's is cold and sad. But let they both be blessed, for they have renounced immortality for the sake of love.

* * *

Could Elrond have foreseen the consequences of the meeting of his daughter and the young Dunedain leader? Yes! Could he have prevented or, at least, delayed it? Undoubtedly! But the meeting occurred. Not because the Lord showed carelessness, and not even because fate intervened... Everything is simpler. Their meeting was planned... Because the war was coming. Because once again the Ring appeared, and Sauron would sooner or later find out *who had it...* And in Rivendell they stopped preparing leaders and started to prepare a king...

"Tinuviel!" whispered Estel, when he heard the song of the Maiden, as Beren had done once... And what else could a romantic young man who was brought up on elven ballads have whispered!.. *(Have you ever seen what kind of impression violin sounds in a quiet spring forest make on a girl?.. I have... A butterfly flying towards the fire, a rabbit enchanted by a boa constrictor compared to it are cynical anarchists... I remember when the bastard Bakhmet parodied Vivaldi in the Peterhof park, I was sitting next to him, and my heart was crisscrossed with black lianas of envy... More and more silhouettes in light garments were floating to the clearing from behind dark oaks. And the moon bathed in light the girls' happy faces, not encumbered by any signs of reason... Unfortunately, I only knew how to play the piano... or rather, on a piano, preferans...)*

Perhaps nothing illustrates the far-sightedness and foresight of the Elven Lords so much as this seemingly random meeting. The war of Gondor and Mordor was still brewing somewhere in the east, and a scheme of political relations with the victorious country had been already prepared in Imladris! No elf doubted the devotion of Aragorn the Strider. But the loyalty of King Elessar had to be strengthened. And in this matter, it is better not to be skimpy! Moreover, the price is not too high. Just the freedom of one elven girl. And as a result, the whole nation will sail over the Sea, not being afraid of a traitorous stab in the back. The elven queen will not allow her husband (and later, her son, if the emigration takes too long) to go against relatives... *Do not be sad, granddaughter, if this one does not become king — the next one will. In a hundred years you'll go out into the forest and sing again. You have a beautiful voice, and Edain men were the same in all of the Ages...*

Almost thirty years had passed and they met again, now in Lorien. And they swore allegiance to one another and kept it piously. Aragorn already had heirs. He took an oath with a pure heart. For Arwen, this engagement could mean both a lot and not much. *"Until death do us part,"* — spoken by an elf, such a phrase, you must agree, reeks of cynicism... No, no, Arwen's oath was worse than Aragorn's oath. It condemned her to eternal solitude after the death of her husband. This is the greatness of the elves of the House of Elrond. They could light-heartedly sacrifice themselves, but they would never become loose political change... *Raise your head, father, and walk away with dignity! From now on, Elrond the Half-elven has no debts in Middle-earth. And it does not matter to me who my husband will be — a lord or a vagabond... If in a hundred years the grandmother again needs a bride for the King of Gondor, let her announce the contest "Miss Lorien."*

Did Aragorn understand on the day of the engagement, what Arwen gave him? I'm sure he did. He was no longer a naive young man, but a mature tempered warrior. And a politician. Perhaps, it was then that true love came to him. A lot of time had passed after the first meeting. He had known women. He had tackled the problems of a warrior and a leader. What was this long-time fascination for him! In any case, how often do we marry our high school sweethearts? But this marriage was as necessary to him as it was to elves. So that the torn Gondor got a peaceful break, a time to recover. So that Lorien was confident of its loyalty and would not provoke a new war. The Strider does not yet know whether he will become king, but in any case, he should be ready...

And suddenly a proud elven princess swears an oath of loyalty to Aragorn, burdened with important matters of state! Not to a king — to a vagabond!!! And under the effeminate shell he sees an unbending warrior, sacrificing herself in the name of her people, or her father — it does not matter... And a new love came to the leader, not timid like a spring flower, but indestructible and terrible like a sword in his hand.

And at that moment the fate of Middle-earth was decided!

Let us leave our lovebirds for the time being, and brush up on the events more dear to soldiers' hearts.

In 3018 the gates of Mordor opened, and the hordes of Sauron rushed to Osgiliath. The abscess of the centuries-old confrontation between the two powers burst. The War of the Rings began. And a year before that a small event took place, inconspicuous against the backdrop of this cataclysm. Yet it produced a much greater stir in the high elven circles. Aragorn caught Gollum, and it turned out that this miserable creature had been in the dungeons of Barad Dur! That is, Sauron learned that the Ring had not been lost, and, moreover, that elves did not have it. And, *having released Gollum* from the dungeons of Barad Dur, the Enemy declared this openly. And went all in. Either he will get the Ring and give it away personally, at his own discretion, or else he will force the Firstborn to use it. In order to make it clear to anyone what all the fuss is about, he sends the Nazgul to the Shire, and they, more or less, fulfill the task...

Of course, elves did not need the war at all. It's not that it really frightened them — they were ready for it — but it forced the events too much. The Exodus was approaching. And they did not mind postponing the denouement for an indefinite time. Sauron did not aspire to this war either. He was under a comfortable illusion that the Ring was doing its job on Galadriel's finger. But in 3009, Gollum happened to drop in and opened his eyes. And the positional war ends. Mordor begins to prepare for an invasion...

Of course, Gandalf was obliged to foresee such a leak of information and shut up Gollum's mouth immediately after Bilbo's campaign. But for some reason, he did nothing in this direction. Or rather, he did, but much later, when the time was lost. Perhaps he postponed the search in favor of more urgent matters, or maybe he just thought Gollum was harmless. Well, who could have known that this freak would jump into the maw of Sauron on his own!..

The Gollum issue surfaced in 3001, almost 60 years after the return of Bilbo. *Scouts of the Enemy* for no obvious reason started showing an increased interest in the Shire. Gandalf understands — Sauron has learned about the Ring. And the magician makes a simple move, winning him a little time. Bilbo arranges a spectacular show with disappearance at the farewell party and leaves for Rivendell, and the Ring, meanwhile, still remains in *Hobbiton.* *"That's it, my friend, don't worry — now It's definitely in Lords' possession..."* Simultaneously, he strengthens the Ranger patrols around the Shire lands and begins to look for the one who gave Sauron information about Bilbo. Could it be treason? Aragorn?! **Elrond?!!!** It's a nightmare!!! Although, maybe it's just Gollum — God willing! And in order to find out the truth, in the same year of 3001 he asks Aragorn to find Gollum. A search for information and a test of loyalty at the same time...

As it turned out later, in that situation, Gandalf had outwitted himself. Sauron learned about the Shire only in eight years, and, indeed, from Gollum! The spies who darted around the Shire, on the other hand, belonged to *Saruman the Wise*. And as the head of the White Council, he knew perfectly well that no Ring had arrived at Rivendell — he would have been informed about it. He had embarked on the path of betrayal only a year ago, and inherent modesty did not allow him to openly announce a change in the policy of Isengard. But the sprouts of distrust and suspicion between the White and the Grey, apparently, had germinated even earlier (who knows what a fight there had been in the White Council for the chairman's seat). By sending scouts to the Shire, Saruman only wanted to find out why the Rangers guard it so vigilantly. And Bilbo explained this to him, by putting on the Ring on his 111th birthday. Perhaps the White Magician had a good laugh at the embarrassing performance of Gandalf, but Sauron did not even hear about it! The black horsemen who arrived in Bag End in September 3018 searched for a *Baggins.* The name "Frodo" was never mentioned at the time of the questioning of local residents. They were looking for Bilbo!

You are probably at a loss, gentlemen! What, you'd say, does this nonsense have to do with Aragorn and Arwen? Perhaps, I will seem to you a naive romantic, but in my opinion, it all stems from the oath of loyalty that the princess gave a vagabond...

Aragorn did not find Gollum, *according to the official version...* But I'm sure that he **did!** But, unlike the Lords, he *needed* a war! Only a war gave him a chance to get the crown. And he drove Gollum to Mordor. Moreover, he did it so finely and elegantly that neither the "game" nor Sauron nor, subsequently, Gandalf, when interrogating the prisoner, did not even suspect the participation of the Dunedain... *"He /Gollum/ set out and came back westward, as far as the Great River. But then he turned aside. He was not daunted by the distance, I am sure. No, something else drew him away. So my friends think, those that hunted him for me."* (Gandalf, LotR, Book I, Ch. 2) I believe that those friends frightened him themselves, my dear. Although, perhaps you had a hunch...

*You will be the Queen of Gondor, my love! I will set fire to Middle-earth and put the crown at your feet... Or I will turn to ash along with my people...*

This impudent, unauthorized operation required courage no less than the Paths of the Dead. And skill, too (the Nazgul couldn't even compete!). And *royal* mentality. Not a leader — a king made a decision and saw it through without asking anyone for advice, let alone permission... And Aragorn's determination did not ruin, but saved Gondor, for, as it turned out, time worked for Sauron. A coup d'état was brewing in Rohan. *The White Horse*, thanks to the efforts of Grima, was turning into *the White Hand.* And this hand was already starting to protrude the middle finger in the direction of Minas Tirith...

But Aragorn arrived in Rohan in time, and Gondor won! And its victory is owed not to the Wisdom of the Wise, but to the Foolishness of the Lover...

* * *

They lived in marriage for one hundred and twenty-two years.

*In the year 120 of the Fourth Age, on March 1, on his birthday, King Elessar passed the scepter and the crown to his son Eldarion. He said goodbye to his wife and daughters, and, not clinging more to life, went to the tomb and closed his eyes forever. This was the wise custom of the kings of Numenor. Queen Arwen returned to the withered, deserted Lorien and, having accepted the Gift of the Younger Children, followed her husband...*

### The Havens

Elves come here to sail to the West. Dwarves come here to earn money on building ships. Forest is being brought here, I do not know by whom and from where... The Havens very much resemble a free port city in which entrepreneurship is flourishing. A kind of Hong Kong. There is, however, a very important difference — the Havens work for emigration. The money invested in a ship will not return. Because the ship itself will not return. The Valars will not allow shuttle trips because it is impossible to hide this information in an anthill that is the Havens. Hence, to the costs already mentioned, Cirdan the Shipwright should add a navigational school in which elves of Lorien, who have never even seen a sea with their own eyes, will learn at least the basics of maritime studies. And he must also maintain the military escort ships, accompanying the migrants to the forbidden waters... Pirates, you know...

A reasonable question arises: where does the money come from? The only answer — the passage to Valinor was provided for a fee. And the fee was rather significant! In order to recoup all the costs of the trip from one trip only. But elves going to the West do not bend under the weight of gold at all. Rather, they carry precious stones. Can you guess where from? Of course from Moria! An interesting alchemical reaction is revealed: food — gems — a ship. And at the origins of this chain is Lothlorien. Galadriel pays fare not only for her subjects but also for the elves of Rivendell. "You suck at economics, dude! Such a flow of gems for thousands of years would cause inflation, and the whole enterprise would go down," you would say, and, probably, you would be right. A more solid currency is required. A kind of currency one can never have too much of. And such a currency exists! Have you guessed? Of course, it's mithril! Unlike dwarves, orcs, apparently, had a very vague idea about its price. So the Balrog who cleared Moria from the Durin's folk significantly lowered the purchase price of the most expensive metal of Middle-earth... And the full stocks of the Morian mithril never reached Sauron, which Gandalf lamented so much about (LotR, Book II, Ch. 4). /Probably the author meant the Gandalf's words "Of what they brought to light the Orcs have gathered nearly all, and given it in tribute to Sauron, who covets it.", implying that the majority of available mithril was yet to be mined. — *translator.*/ And thank God! Imagine a troll in mithril armor... A nightmare! But in principle, all this is lyrics — with mithril or without, but a real treasure river was flowing through Eregion and Shire to the Havens. And hereby a mystery is revealed, which, it would seem, has nothing to do with elves. The mystery of the fall of Arnor.

This kingdom, like Gondor, had its own counterweight — Angmar. In 1409 the army of the Witch-king invades Arnor. The kingdom is saved from the final rout by the elves of Elrond and Cirdan. The enemy seems to be defeated. But yet again, not completely! Five hundred years later, Angmar again raises its head, and two kindred powers (Gondor and Arnor) form an alliance in 1940. It is not too difficult to guess against whom this alliance is directed. The Witch-king had been annoying both Arnor and Gondor for a while. It would seem that no one can end it once and for all, with one joint blow. But the allies are inexplicably inactive for 34 years! If you do not score, they will score you. In 1973, the Witch-king strikes at the Northern Kingdom. In 1974 it is crushed. And only a year later, in 1975 (!), the Gondorian fleet arrives in the Havens, an army disembarks and devastates the Angmarian hordes, again with the participation of the Havens and Rivendell, in the Battle of Fornost. From now on, the North, both dark and light, does not participate in the politics of Middle-earth. The Lord of the Nazgul loses interest in the Arnorian ruins and rushes to the South — to Gondor. And the kin of Arvedui become wanderers.

What does this all mean, gentlemen?! What kind of bullshit are they trying to sell us, please forgive the vulgarism, but how else would you put it! How timely elves send the military aid?! How Earnil gathers the fleet in a hurry?! Why even the fleet? In 34 years the army could get there over dry land. The same route, by the way, the Fellowship tackled in just four months. And not along a road, mind you, but through Moria, Lorien and other gullies.

And the reason for the whole thing is the union treaty. This alliance became the death sentence for Arnor. And elves passed it. The fleet that Prince Earnur lead to Lyndon began to gather **before the attack** of Angmar! That expedition had the goal of uniting the forces of the two kingdoms in the forthcoming war. The Witch-king just very wisely made a preemptive strike. And it was elves who hastened it. For with the fall of Angmar, the interjacent lands, specifically, Eregion, would be very quickly divided among the allies. No, nobody would attack Elrond and Cirdan (at least not right away). But on the way from Lorien to the Havens there would appear so many customs checkpoints that the Firstborn would be boarding the ships in the "firstborn" form, that is, naked. And elves are skilfully preventing the land campaign of the Gondorian army for 34 years. Since if Gondor passes through Eregion, it **will stay there.**

Who knows, maybe one of the reasons for the Elrond's fatherly love of Aragorn was a thousand years of shame for betraying his ancestor. For the only one who could have kept Gondor from a land trip to the north was Lord Elrond...


### The Golden Wood

In principle, almost everything possible has been said about Lorien. Its little pointy ears can be spotted in Moria, Eregion, and even in Mordor. It is the center of the web that has entangled Middle-earth. But there is one point from which I deliberately shied away, leaving it for dessert.

It is here that we have a situation where one literally cannot see the forest behind the trees. But if one just slightly pushes away the branches...

The thing is that neither the administrative, political, nor, especially, financial activity of the Lords of the Golden Wood explains its phenomenal isolation from the whole world. Being located right under Mordor's nose, Lorien does not even try to enter into an alliance with either Rohan or Gondor. Moreover, its reputation in these states is negative rather than positive.

Apparently, Lords are not particularly worried about the outcome of the military conflict between the West and the East. I can see only one possibility for such carelessness — a reliable way of retreat to the Havens, under the cover of Elrond's swords and Cirdan's towers. This way lies through the tunnels of Khazad-dum, but I am not going to repeat myself...

Everything seems to be logical, doesn't it, gentlemen? A perfect explanation for the strange seclusion of Lorien?.. But the fact of the matter is that this is not the *reason*, but the *ability* to self-isolate.

And the reason is that Galadriel, a woman of enormous pride, did not want to return to Valinor as a beaten dog. She had to bring to the Valar something that even they did not have. The reason for closing off Lorien is not fear, but secrecy. There is such a huge mystery hidden there, that it cannot be revealed even to the closest relatives in Mirkwood...

*"Yet if you succeed, then our power is diminished, and Lothlorien will fade..."* says Galadriel to Frodo (LotR, Book II, Ch. 7). And Lorien really did fade after the departure of the Galadhrim, as its mistress predicted. Or rather, mallorns faded. And why, actually?!! These amazing trees were gifted to Gil-galad by the sixth king of Numenor (and to Numenor they were brought from the legendary island of Eressea), but they did not take root in Lindon. But where Galadriel had planted them, a unique forest grew up. And after elves left Lorien this forest should have persisted. If the giant trees need some kind of special care — what's the problem? Instruct the neighboring elves — they will happily take your place, and the mallorns will stay alive. But no! Lorien dies. And together with it dies the greatest mystery of Middle-earth...

*"... he /Frodo/ laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder: never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and texture of a tree's skin and of the life within it. He felt a delight in wood and the touch of it... it was the delight of the living tree itself."* (LotR, Book II, Ch. 6) A colossal tree, able to feel, wagging its tail happily when the owner touches it... How big do you think should the root system of such a giant be in order to keep it safely in the soil and supply the necessary amount of water etc?.. Generally, any tree very much resembles an iceberg — its underground part is much larger and more branched out than the part above ground. The soil of Lorien from the surface to the groundwater and, perhaps, below it was riddled, braided and entangled with the roots of mallorns. In fact, all of the Lorien mallorns have long become parts of a single underground organism consisting of myriads of ropes, bundles, threads, fibers, webs, villi etc, capable of feeling or, to simplify, conducting a nervous impulse. And obeying the master. And suppressing anything unnecessary with plant inhibitors. And encouraging whatever is necessary... Mallorns of Lorien, gentlemen, were a little different from mallorns of Numenor. Due to this "small" difference, Lorien elves came close to *ruling over the plant world of Arda!* The Golden Wood was a managed biocenosis (any geobotanist would tremble from such a phrase). This is more impressive than all the rings taken together because it really is **power...** Lorien did not have to wage wars, it was enough for it to feed, and it could feed not only Moria... *They say you love mushrooms, Master Frodo? Milk-caps, penny buns? Come here the day after tomorrow... I am not going to say anything! It's a surprise! Just come...*

That's why this terrible secrecy is needed! So that the information on the developments of the Galadhrim did not leak to the outer world. And it is for the same reason that Lorien "faded". When a top-secret laboratory is evacuated, anything that can not be taken with you must be destroyed... And it seems to me, gentlemen, even the Valar really did not have this!

Based on this hypothesis, it becomes clear why elves did not hurry to leave Middle-earth until the very last moment. A little bit more and... *It's on sale, people! The blessed soil of the Golden Wood! Almost for free. Spray over your garden and forget any grief! The fence itself will blossom! The first thousand buyers get the seed of a mallorn! **For free!..***

Of course, by letting the Company enter the wood, Galadriel risked, despite all the measures taken (see above, *The Ruling Ring* section). And a special danger for the secret of the Galadhrim was concealed in... Sam Gamgee. At the sight of the first Lorien garden bed, this professional gardener had an epilepsy attack... And then he started asking questions. There were a lot of them, and they were extremely embarrassing to modest elven farmers. *You doubt needlessly, Master Gamgee, it's just **magic**. You can reproduce the same thing in the Shire.* Galadriel was forced to share her technology with the persistent hobbit. She gives him a bribe. To make Sam's questions stay in Lorien, to make the secret shared, and most importantly, to get the gardener from the Shire believe: the Lorien miracle is just **magic**...


#### Galadriel

*Intrigues, betrayal, hypocrisy — of which sins haven't I accused elves! But despite such heavy accusations, I cannot help but admire them. Any acts performed by the Firstborn, even the most treacherous, are permeated with perfection and beauty. Is it possible to approach them at all with the miserable standards of human morality, this empty-headed coquette, which changes her outfits every decade? And can a tongue-tied one talk about the beauty of the sunrise? Probably, not. But I'll try. I will venture to describe a fleeting smile, a rustle of a dress, a movement of a fan of the one who knew how to Win and knew how to Lose, like no one in the world...*

The loss of Gandalf in Moria was a heavy blow to the Company. They needed a layover, a time to rest and adjust further actions. And Lorien opened its doors very timely and provided such an opportunity. But there is no perfection in the world, and hospitality for some can become humiliation for others... A dwarf of royal origin (Gimli leads his lineage from the king Nain II) was insulted publicly **twice.** And if Haldir's demand for a blindfold can still be attributed to the soldier's reinsurance, Celeborn's accusation of waking up the Balrog... *"Let Gimli forgive my harsh words..."* — the Lord's apologies are touching and warm. But **I do not believe** that a contemporary of Arda in thousands of years have not learned to restrain his emotions and does not know how dangerous it is to offend a dwarf, wherever. Even in his own palace! In exactly the same ridiculous way, because of the contemptuous attitude towards the undermountain smiths, the Lord Elu Thingol died...

The lord of the Galadhrim knows everything perfectly. And he certainly knows the story of the death of his own father... A psychological attack on Gimli is not caused by neglect, not by frivolity, but by a *heightened* interest. And in this insignificant episode the unique *diplomatic method* of the Golden Wood circa the end of the Third Age is revealed! Just like the whole sky reflects in a small puddle of water. The Lords do not assess the situation as "good" or "bad", do not ignore or correct, but masterfully steer it in the right direction. Whether the Easterlings became more active in the north, the Nazgul took Dol Guldur, or a dwarf of royal lineage was casually insulted — the *only* question is: how can Lorien benefit from this?

And now the frowning Gimli appears before the blessed eyes, and the royal spouses, like a "bad" and a "good" cop, mold from him whatever they need. Offended? — perfect! Finish him! Make him feel cold and hostility! Plunge him into the ocean of solitude! So that even those with whom he fought side by side, looked away bashfully! And at this moment — a single phrase of encouragement from someone about whom he did not even dare to think. And in this phrase, love and sympathy and *the warmth of home!* *Cold are the springs of Kibil-nala...* An elven word is just as devastating as an elven arrow that flies into the slit of a helmet. And now Gimli the brawler is hanging from the belt of the golden-haired archeress like a shot-down hare!..

But why?.. Isn't it too much attention for an undistinguished thangar?! /A self-name of dwarves that was (seemingly) introduced by N. Perumov in his trilogy "The Ring of Darkness", a sequel to LotR — *translator.*/ Patience, my friends...

How the relations of the Lady and her tame dwarf developed afterward in Lorien is not known. We only know that Gimli and Legolas often disappeared somewhere. I believe the Mirkwood elf played the part of a chaperone at the meetings of Gimli and the queen. I do not think that the dwarf became a banal favorite, that line, for many reasons, should not have been crossed. The meetings were of a purely friendly nature but were not particularly advertised. When parting, the dwarf addressed Galadriel with a request, which was "bold" and "courteous" at the same time. He took advantage of the right to choose a farewell gift, offered *to him alone,* and wished for a lock of Lady's hair. Officially, with everyone present... And did you know, gentlemen, that back in Valinor Galadriel refused the same request from **Feanor** himself, the creator of the Silmarils?!! (If I name the reason for this refusal — the elf fans will tear my head off) /This is mentioned in "Unfinished Tales" ("The History of Galadriel and Celeborn"), but not in "Silmarillion" proper — *translator.*/ And the dwarf received this gift! We will assume that from the side of Galadriel this was a regal caprice, but Gimli, from now on until the end of his life, is doomed to love the one who saw Durin's awakening. It is both sad and funny. *But no reproaches, my love! To be a fleeting whim of Eternity is already a great honor! And one can live even with a broken heart, as it turns out...*

And you can write off everything on a royal whim and stop at this if it were not for the news from Lorien brought by Gandalf (LotR, Book III, Ch. 5). Passing messages from Galadriel to Aragorn and Legolas, the old rascal makes a pause for effect. (I can understand when a tenth-grader teases a friend in love, but a wizard! Either conversing with the Balrog has left its mark, or this ancient Maia-vagabond really remained a boy deep in his soul...) And Gimli cannot stand it: *"Then she sent me no message?"* In this short question there is nothing but resentment and betrayed expectation! Excuse me, but in relation to "Eternity," such emotions are not appropriate! Come to your senses, dwarf, you have already received more than you deserve! But, it turns out, Gloin's son does not wait in vain. *"'What is that?' said Gandalf, opening his eyes* (that bastard!) *'...Your pardon, Gimli! I was pondering the messages, once again. ...To Gimli son of Gloin, ...give his Lady's greeting. ...my thought goes with thee.'"* Nothing reprehensible or discreditable! And do you know why? Because nothing is hidden, it is all in sight! But imagine Gandalf saying this phrase in the dwarf's ear, or even calling him aside... Well, to hell with it. The question "did it happen or not" I leave to gossips. I'm interested in something else. *What for?!* Why does the high elven queen demonstrate special attention towards and ordinary thangar? And even officially recognizes him as her knight! It's simple. Before us is the virtuoso work of a master of political intrigue — *the creation of a leader.* Who was Gimli before the campaign of the Fellowship? Zero! I'm not afraid of this word. And who would he become after the campaign? One of the nine Heroes, distinguished by nothing in particular. The only dwarf who was entrusted to accompany the hobbit with the Ring. But a very promising dwarf! Especially if you single him out from the homogeneous mass of the Fellowship, associate some beautiful, soul-rending legend with his name... This story is very similar to the "promotion" of some contemporary pop stars.

And after the War of the Rings, Gimli's star shone on the political sky of Middle-earth. For thangar youth from the Blue Mountains to the Iron Hills, he became a legend, Che Guevara, if you will. It is not said directly, but it was he who led the restoration work in the liberated Moria. Remaining the subject of Dain, the son of Gloin rose above the kings, for his throne was the adoration of the masses. And this shadowy leader of Middle-earth obeyed the movement of his mistress's little finger. If we imagine the impossible, if a new enemy of the Golden Wood were to turn up, I'm sure that not just arrows, but axes too would meet him at the edge of the forest! *Take off your apron, lad! To hell with the hammer! To hell with the dull master! Old boy Gimli calls for brave men to swing an ax to the glory of his Lady!* Well, how much is the smile of Galadriel worth, gentlemen?..

After the death of Aragorn, Legolas sailed over the sea. Rumor has it that his friend Gimli went with him. Galadriel could get a special favor for her knight. Doubtful, of course, but I really want it to be true...

*But the Holy Virgin pleaded*  
*For his soul before the King,*  
*Letting into Heaven’s kingdom*  
*Her beloved paladin.*

## Chapter 3, the shortest one. On dwarves

The Book does not talk much about them, and all the data are mainly related to the Third Age. Their existence in the Ancient days is shrouded in a rather dense fog. The reason is clear: they are the third ones in line. The book is silent about them because the Master, gravitating more towards elves and men, just did not have time... But not just that. The fact is that this silence is *bashful.*

Answer me a simple question: how did ancient dwarves fend for themselves? You will say: you idiot, they sold ironware, jewelry, worked in quarries, construction etc. No, no, before that... There are elementary laws of the development of a society. One of them states that trade appears only when there are *surpluses* in a *subsistence economy.* If you, after coming to a new place, start building a smithy first, you will simply die of hunger. *Do you want to exchange your hatchet for my lovely carrot? What? Too little?! Well, let's get back to this conversation in three days...* Take any people on earth and look at its history. You will see that the distant ancestors of this people were either farmers, or cattle-breeders, or engaged in hunting and so on. And what did the ancestors of dwarves do? Is there something similar on our mother Earth? There is! Just be calm, do not faint. The *gypsies*. By the way, their self-name *"Roma"* means *"blacksmiths".* They left India and, somewhere in the 14th and 15th century, appeared in Europe. They did not kill anybody, did not conquer anything, on the contrary — they always politely asked kings for a permission to settle in their lands. And then settled. But unfortunately for the gypsies, Europe had plenty of its own smiths at that time! As a result, the *"blacksmiths"* had to change their vocation...

The dwarves were more fortunate. They also came to the occupied lands. They also politely asked the Elven Lords to give them shelter... And the Lords graciously accepted them. And even gave them places to settle! And even provided them with food!!! In exchange for stone. Dwarves, gentlemen, settled on bare rocks not because they adored the mountains. The appearance of a homeless tribe was very fortunate for the Elven Lords. They got at their disposal a lot of ridiculously cheap stonemasons. And the cities of the Firstborn surged into the sky with beautiful towers and delicate minarets.
