# Letters to Ingar (a translation from Russian)

The article tries to imagine what kind of real-world events could have led to the myth that is the Lord of the Rings. While at some secondary matters the author was misled by inaccurate Russian translations (see my notes in the text), the main points of the work still stand. I hope it will be interesting for someone.

Those who read Russian can find the original in the repository. 

Language corrections are appreciated, either as pull requests here, or by e-mail.
